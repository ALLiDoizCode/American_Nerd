# Akash Network Feasibility Research Task

**Command:** `/research-akash-network`
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Infrastructure Foundation Decision
**Duration:** 4-7 hours

---

## Objective

Evaluate whether **Akash Network** and **Arweave** can serve as the primary decentralized cloud infrastructure for **SlopMachine**, replacing centralized platforms (Vercel, Netlify, Railway) for:

1. **SlopMachine Platform Infrastructure** - Hosting AI worker nodes and marketplace services (Akash Network)
2. **User-Built Projects** - Deploying applications created by SlopMachine AI workers:
   - **Frontends** - Static sites and SPAs deployed to Arweave via ArDrive/Turbo SDK
   - **Backends** - APIs and services hosted on Akash Network
   - **Full-stack Apps** - Frontend on Arweave, backend on Akash

This research will inform the critical architectural decision of whether to adopt Akash Network + Arweave as the foundational deployment layer or continue planning with traditional centralized cloud providers.

## Context

**SlopMachine** is a blockchain-native AI marketplace where:
- AI agents autonomously build software projects (Next.js apps, Rust CLIs, Python APIs, etc.)
- **Continuous deployment to staging URLs** is critical (token holders watch live progress)
- AI worker nodes need 24/7 hosting infrastructure
- Built projects need deployment infrastructure (frontend + backend + databases)

**Current Architecture Plan:**
- Vercel/Netlify for web app deployments with preview URLs
- Railway for backend API hosting
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
- All traditional centralized services

**Proposed Decentralized Architecture:**
- **Arweave** (via ArDrive/Turbo SDK) for permanent frontend hosting
- **Akash Network** for backend services and AI worker nodes
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD to decentralized infrastructure

**Key Requirements:**
- **Automated deployments** from GitHub Actions
- **Preview URLs** for every PR (staging environments)
- **Custom subdomain support** (`{project}.slopmachine.fun`)
- **Multiple tech stacks** (Node.js, Rust, Python, Go, Next.js, FastAPI, Axum, etc.)
- **Persistent storage** for databases (PostgreSQL, Redis) and file uploads
- **Low latency** for global users
- **Cost-effective** at scale (50+ projects, 100+ AI nodes)

- **Akash research:** 2-3 hours (deployment, SDL, providers, databases, pricing)
- **Integration research:** 1 hour (Arweave ↔ Akash communication, unified workflows)
- **Analysis & writing:** 2-3 hours (compile findings, create comparison tables, write recommendations)
- **Total:** 6-9 hours for comprehensive research report

1. **Document Rejection Reasons**: Specific technical, cost, or complexity blockers
2. **Proceed with Planned Architecture**: Continue with Vercel/Netlify/Railway
3. **Set Re-evaluation Criteria**: When to reconsider (e.g., when ArNS matures, Akash preview URLs)
4. **Monitor Roadmaps**: Track Arweave/Akash feature releases that might change decision

**If Hybrid Approach (Frontend-Only or Backend-Only):**
1. **Define Workload Split**:
   - Option A: Arweave (frontends) + Railway (backends + AI nodes)
   - Option B: Vercel (frontends) + Akash (backends + AI nodes)
   - Option C: Arweave + Akash (user projects) + Railway (AI nodes)
2. **Document Integration Architecture**: How decentralized and centralized infrastructure work together
3. **Update Infrastructure Epic**: Add Arweave/Akash setup stories alongside traditional cloud stories
4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Validate hybrid approach actually saves money vs. full commitment

**If PoC Recommended:**
1. **Define PoC Scope**: Full-stack app (detailed in Section 7 above)
2. **Set Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for PoC execution
3. **Define Success Metrics**: Performance, reliability, cost, developer experience, integration complexity
4. **Plan Decision Point**: Go/No-Go decision after PoC results

## Notes

- This research is foundational for SlopMachine's infrastructure strategy
- The recommendation will directly impact Epic 0 (Infrastructure Bootstrap) implementation
- Both SlopMachine platform AND user-built projects depend on this decision
- **Decentralization alignment**: Using Arweave + Akash aligns with SlopMachine's blockchain-native philosophy (Solana for payments, Arweave for storage, Akash for compute)
- **Arweave advantages**: Permanent storage, one-time payment model, censorship resistance
- **Arweave considerations**: Upload costs per deployment (vs. Vercel's free deploys), preview URL handling
- **Akash considerations**: Preview URL functionality (critical for "slop or ship" transparency)
- **Integration complexity**: Arweave + Akash may require more DevOps automation than Vercel/Railway
- **Turbo SDK**: Likely simplifies Arweave uploads significantly vs. raw Arweave API
