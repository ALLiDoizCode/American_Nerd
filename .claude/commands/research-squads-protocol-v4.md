# Squads Protocol V4 Technical Spike

**Command:** `/research-squads-protocol-v4`
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Week 1 Blocker
**Duration:** 2-3 days

---

## Objective

Conduct a comprehensive technical investigation of Squads Protocol V4 to determine the optimal Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) integration approach for the American Nerd Marketplace escrow system. This research will inform implementation decisions for blockchain-native payment coordination, enabling secure fund management for AI-powered software development projects.

## Context

**Project:** American Nerd Marketplace - A blockchain-native marketplace where autonomous AI agents perform software development work (planning, architecture, development, QA) with human validation gates.

**Current Architecture Decision:** Use Squads Protocol V4 via CPI instead of building custom escrow logic. Rationale: battle-tested security (4 audits, $15B+ secured), faster time-to-market, lower audit costs.

**Integration Requirements:**
- Anchor framework (0.30.0+) for smart contract development
- Program ID: `SQDS4ep65T869zMMBKyuUq6aD6EgTu8psMjkvj52pCf` (mainnet)
- Payment flows: Client deposits ‚Üí Validator approves ‚Üí Multi-recipient splits (85% dev, 10% QA, 5% platform)
- Refund scenarios for rejected work

**Technical Constraints:**
- Solana blockchain (Rust/Anchor)
- SOL-native transactions (no stablecoins)
- Pyth oracle for SOL/USD price conversion
- Must support programmatic approval by validator nodes

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions (Must Answer)

1. **CPI Integration Pattern**: What is the exact Anchor code pattern for invoking Squads V4 escrow operations via CPI? Include initialization, deposit, approval, and release with splits.

2. **Escrow Lifecycle Management**: What is the complete state machine for a Squads V4 escrow transaction from creation through completion? What accounts are required at each step?

3. **Multi-Recipient Splits**: How does Squads V4 handle payment splitting to multiple recipients (e.g., 85% developer, 10% QA reviewer, 5% platform)? Can splits be defined at initialization or must they be specified at release?

4. **Arbiter/Approval Mechanism**: How does the validator/arbiter approval pattern work in Squads V4? Can our smart contract programmatically approve releases, or does it require multisig human intervention?

5. **Refund Workflow**: What is the technical process for refunding escrowed funds if work is rejected? Who has authority to initiate refunds, and what state transitions occur?

6. **Account Structure Requirements**: What PDA (Program Derived Address) patterns and account structures must our program create/manage to interact with Squads V4?

7. **Transaction Size & Compute Limits**: What are the compute unit costs and transaction size implications of Squads V4 CPI calls? Are there batching strategies for gas optimization?

8. **Error Handling**: What are the common error codes/scenarios when interacting with Squads V4, and how should our program handle them?

### Secondary Questions (Nice to Have)

1. What monitoring/event patterns does Squads V4 emit that we can subscribe to for payment tracking?

2. Are there rate limits or anti-spam mechanisms in Squads V4 that could affect high-frequency marketplace operations?

3. What are the devnet testing considerations? Is there a devnet deployment of Squads V4, or must we mock the interface?

4. How do Squads V4 transactions appear in Solana explorers? What metadata is exposed for transparency?

5. Are there known edge cases or gotchas from the audit reports that we should design around?

6. What versioning strategy does Squads use? How are breaking changes communicated?
