        Based on Stack Exchange verified configuration (https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/23265):

        Change Cargo.toml dependencies to:
          [dependencies]
          anchor-lang = "0.29.0"
          anchor-spl = "0.29.0"
          pyth-solana-receiver-sdk = "0.3.2"
          borsh = "~1.2"  # Explicit constraint ensures compatibility

        Steps:
        1. Update Cargo.toml with above versions
        2. Run: cargo update
        3. Run: RUST_LOG=error anchor build --no-idl
        4. Verify build succeeds
        5. Implement unit tests (AC8-10)
        6. Run: anchor test
        7. Update Change Log with downgrade rationale

        Pros:
        - Proven working configuration (Stack Exchange community verified)
        - Immediate unblock (same-day resolution)
        - Low risk (known stable versions)

        Cons:
        - Lose Anchor 0.30-0.31 features (if any were being used)
        - Need to re-upgrade later when Pyth ecosystem catches up
        - Temporary technical debt

        Timeline: 2-4 hours (dependency update + build verification + test run)
        Risk: LOW (proven configuration with community validation)

        Upgrade Path Back:
        When pyth-solana-receiver-sdk 0.7+ (or newer pyth-sdk-solana) releases with borsh 1.5+ support:
        1. Upgrade anchor-lang/anchor-spl to 0.31+ (or latest stable)
        2. Upgrade pyth-solana-receiver-sdk to compatible version
        3. Remove explicit borsh constraint
        4. cargo update && anchor build --no-idl
        5. Run full test suite to verify
        6. Create story to track upgrade work

      details: |
        Monitor Pyth ecosystem for compatible releases:
        - pyth-solana-receiver-sdk 0.7+ with borsh 1.5+ support
        - pyth-sdk-solana 0.11+ with borsh 1.5+ support
        - Any official Pyth guidance on Anchor 0.31+ compatibility

        Steps:
        1. Subscribe to Pyth GitHub repo releases (pyth-network/pyth-crosschain)
        2. Check crates.io weekly for new versions
        3. When compatible version releases, update Cargo.toml
        4. Build and test immediately

        Pros:
        - Keep Anchor 0.31 (no downgrade needed)
        - Future-proof solution (no technical debt)
        - No workarounds or custom code

        Cons:
        - Blocks story completion indefinitely (uncertain timeline)
        - Relies on Pyth team priorities (no control)
        - May delay project milestones

        Timeline: Unknown (2-6 weeks estimate based on ecosystem velocity and similar past updates)
        Risk: MEDIUM (uncertain timeline, may extend longer)

        Implement custom Pyth price account deserialization without any Pyth SDK dependency.

        Research Required:
        - Pyth on-chain account layout (32-byte header, price struct format)
        - Price struct fields: i64 price, i32 expo, u64 conf, i64 publish_time
        - Byte offsets and endianness (little-endian)
        - Account discriminator validation

        Implementation Steps:
        1. Research Pyth price account byte layout (docs.pyth.network or source code)
        2. Define Pyth account structs matching on-chain format:
           ```rust
           #[repr(C)]
           struct PythPriceAccount {
               magic: u32,
               version: u32,
               account_type: u32,
               // ... more fields based on research
               price: i64,
               conf: u64,
               expo: i32,
               publish_time: i64,
           }
           ```
        3. Implement manual deserialization in get_sol_price_usd():
           ```rust
           let data = pyth_account.data.borrow();
           let price_account: &PythPriceAccount = bytemuck::from_bytes(&data[..size_of::<PythPriceAccount>()]);
           ```
        4. Remove pyth-solana-receiver-sdk dependency from Cargo.toml
        5. Add bytemuck crate for safe casting
        6. Implement comprehensive unit tests for manual parsing logic
        7. Test with real devnet Pyth account to verify byte layout

        Pros:
        - Zero external Pyth dependencies (no future conflicts)
        - Full control over parsing logic
        - No ecosystem wait required
        - Performance may be slightly better (no SDK overhead)

        Cons:
        - Significant development effort (8-12 hours)
        - Ongoing maintenance burden if Pyth changes format
        - Risk of parsing errors leading to incorrect prices (HIGH RISK)
        - Need to track Pyth protocol changes manually
        - No official support from Pyth team

        Timeline: 8-12 hours (3h research + 4h implementation + 3h testing + 2h validation)
        Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH (parsing errors could cause incorrect prices; format changes could break)

        Testing Requirements (CRITICAL):
        - Unit tests with known byte sequences (mock accounts)
        - Integration tests with real devnet Pyth accounts
        - Fuzz testing with corrupted/invalid data
        - Boundary condition tests (zero price, negative expo, etc.)
        - Staleness validation with various timestamps

        Once build succeeds (via Path 1, 2, or 3), implement comprehensive unit tests:

        Required Tests (from Story AC8-10):
        1. USD to lamports conversion at $100/SOL (AC8):
           - $10 USD → expect ~0.101 SOL (with 1% slippage)
           - Verify: lamports = 101_000_000

        2. USD to lamports conversion at $200/SOL (AC8):
           - $10 USD → expect ~0.0505 SOL (with 1% slippage)
           - Verify: lamports = 50_500_000

        3. Minimum bid validation passes (AC9):
           - Mock price: $100/SOL
           - Bid: 0.025 SOL (2.5M lamports) = $2.50
           - Verify: Validation passes

        4. Minimum bid validation fails (AC9):
           - Mock price: $100/SOL
           - Bid: 0.02 SOL (2M lamports) = $2.00
           - Verify: Returns BidBelowMinimumUSD error

        5. Stale price rejected (AC10):
           - Mock Pyth price with publish_time = current_time - 61 seconds
           - Call get_sol_price_usd()
           - Verify: Returns OraclePriceStale error

        6. Fresh price accepted (AC10):
           - Mock Pyth price with publish_time = current_time - 30 seconds
           - Call get_sol_price_usd()
           - Verify: Returns valid price data

        Additional Tests (QA recommendations):
        7. Confidence interval rejection:
           - Mock price: $100/SOL, confidence: $15 (15% > 10% threshold)
           - Verify: Returns OraclePriceUnavailable error

        8. Price range validation:
           - Mock price: $10/SOL (below $20 minimum)
           - Verify: Returns OraclePriceUnavailable error

        9. Overflow protection:
           - USD amount: very large value near u64::MAX
           - Verify: Handles gracefully (error or safe conversion)

        10. Edge cases:
            - Zero USD amount
            - Zero lamports
            - Negative price (if possible from Pyth)

        Test Structure:
        ```rust
        #[cfg(test)]
        mod tests {
            use super::*;
            // Mock Pyth account creation helper
            // Test functions as listed above
        }
        ```

        Target Coverage: 80%+ for oracle.rs module
        Estimated Effort: 4-6 hours

           Verify: All oracle unit tests pass

        2. Run integration tests (requires devnet connection):

           - escrow-workflow.spec.ts (if affected)

        3. Verify Acceptance Criteria 11 (devnet integration test):
           - Connects to devnet Pyth SOL/USD price account
           - Fetches real-time price
           - Price is within reasonable range ($20-$500/SOL)
           - Confidence interval < 10% of price
           - USD↔lamports conversions work with real prices

        4. Verify Acceptance Criteria 12 (full test suite):
           - All existing tests (Stories 1.1-1.5) still pass
           - All new oracle tests pass
           - No regressions introduced

    note: "Third review (THIS REVIEW) - Comprehensive dependency analysis via Cargo.lock inspection and ecosystem research. Confirmed both pyth-sdk-solana v0.10 and pyth-solana-receiver-sdk v0.6 are incompatible with Anchor 0.31.1 due to borsh versioning. Documented three viable resolution paths: (1) Downgrade to Anchor 0.29 + pyth-receiver 0.3.2 + borsh 1.2 [FASTEST - 2-4h], (2) Wait for Pyth SDK update [2-6 weeks], (3) Manual parsing [8-12h]. Remains FAIL until build succeeds and tests execute. Recommendation: Path 1 for immediate unblock."

# RECOMMENDED ACTION (QA opinion)
recommended_path: |
  QUINN'S RECOMMENDATION: Choose RESOLUTION PATH 1 (Downgrade to Compatible Stack)

  Rationale:
  - Fastest unblock (2-4 hours vs weeks or 8-12 hours)
  - Proven configuration (Stack Exchange community verified)
  - Low risk (stable versions with known compatibility)
  - Story can be completed and moved to Done status
  - Upgrade path back documented for when ecosystem catches up
  - No complex custom code to maintain (vs Path 3 manual parsing)
  - No indefinite wait (vs Path 2)

  Story 1.6 is critical for Epic 1 completion (real-time SOL/USD pricing for bid validation).
  Blocking this story delays entire epic. Downgrade is acceptable technical debt given:
  - Anchor 0.30-0.31 features not yet utilized in codebase
  - Easy to upgrade later when Pyth releases compatible SDK
  - Clean upgrade path documented in this gate file

  If project timeline allows 2-6 weeks wait, Path 2 is ideal (no technical debt).
  Path 3 should only be used if both 1 and 2 are unacceptable.
