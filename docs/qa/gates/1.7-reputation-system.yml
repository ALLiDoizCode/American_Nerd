nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent security posture:
      - Anti-gaming mechanisms (success rate multiplier, sqrt diminishing returns, 1.0x floor)
      - Comprehensive overflow protection (checked_add, checked_mul throughout)
      - Tier degradation on slash (economic penalty for poor performance)
      - Input validation (division by zero, tier capping, safe float conversions)
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Optimal performance characteristics:
      - O(1) complexity for all calculations (sqrt, exp, pow, log10)
      - No loops or recursion - deterministic execution (~5-10 CU per function)
      - Float operations only for intermediate calculations, not money values
      - Tier updates only on success/slash (minimal on-chain overhead)
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Production-ready reliability:
      - 16/16 unit tests passing (100% pass rate)
      - Comprehensive edge case coverage (tier 0, 255, u32::MAX, overflow scenarios)
      - Mathematical accuracy validated (all formulas match specification within 0.01 tolerance)
      - Integration with existing handlers seamless (release_payment_and_stake, slash_stake_and_refund)
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Exemplary maintainability:
      - Extensive rustdoc comments explaining formulas, return types, side effects
      - No code duplication - all formulas implemented once in utils/reputation.rs
      - Proper separation of concerns (utils vs instructions vs state)
      - Test helper functions simplify test setup (create_test_node)
      - Descriptive test names describe exact scenarios

# Final assessment
assessment: |
  This implementation is EXEMPLARY and represents best practices for critical blockchain logic:

  STRENGTHS:
  - Mathematical precision: All 4 formulas implemented exactly per specification
  - Comprehensive testing: 16 tests covering all ACs, edge cases, boundary conditions
  - Security excellence: Anti-gaming mechanisms, overflow protection, tier degradation
  - Performance optimized: O(1) complexity, deterministic execution, minimal overhead
  - Maintainability: Excellent documentation, no duplication, proper separation of concerns

  VALIDATION RESULTS:
  ✅ All 9 acceptance criteria fully implemented
  ✅ 16/16 unit tests passing (100% coverage of ACs)
  ✅ Coding standards fully compliant (rustfmt, clippy, checked arithmetic)
  ✅ Zero security/performance/reliability concerns
  ✅ Integration with existing handlers seamless

  MINOR IMPROVEMENTS APPLIED DURING REVIEW:
  - Applied rustfmt to 3 files (import ordering, line wrapping, assert formatting)
  - No functional changes - purely stylistic compliance

  DECISION: PASS - Production-ready, no further changes required.

  NEXT STEPS: Story owner can confidently mark status as "Done".
