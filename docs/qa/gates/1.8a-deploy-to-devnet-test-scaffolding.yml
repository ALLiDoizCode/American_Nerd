  **Story Split Resolution:**
  Product Owner (Sarah) chose Option 1 (Split Story) based on Quinn's recommendation from
  the original QA gate. Story 1.8a successfully delivers deployment + test scaffolding
  infrastructure, which are complete and high-quality deliverables.

  **Story 1.8a Deliverables (COMPLETE):**
  - ✅ Devnet deployment (Program ID: 4hPgUuR7S8pyX7WxgaKTunaPCjMQLhEmBgQEyTrTvDNt)
  - ✅ IDL synced to devnet
  - ✅ Comprehensive test scaffolding (34 tests, 10 suites)
  - ✅ Test infrastructure (devnet config, wallet funding, PDA derivation)
  - ✅ Documentation (README.md updated)
  - ✅ Unit tests passing (67 tests, zero regressions)

  **Story 1.8b Scope (NEW STORY):**
  - Implement register_node instruction
  - Implement create_opportunity instruction
  - Implement accept_bid instruction
  - Enable 32 skipped integration tests
  - Execute full test suite on devnet
  - Document test results

  **Quality Score Rationale:**
  Score increased from 42 → 88 after story split and scope adjustment. Story 1.8a meets
  all 7 adjusted acceptance criteria with high-quality deliverables. Minor deduction for
  airdrop delay performance concern (defer to Story 1.8b).

  **Gate Status: PASS**
  Story 1.8a is complete within its adjusted scope and ready to be marked Done.
