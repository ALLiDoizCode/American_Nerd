# Quality Gate Decision for Story 1.5

schema: 1
story: "1.5"
story_title: "Custom Escrow Program Integration"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 11 acceptance criteria met with excellent code quality, comprehensive security validations, and proper error handling. Single refactoring performed (ambiguous glob re-exports fix). Integration tests appropriately deferred pending prerequisite account structures from Stories 1.2-1.4."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent security posture. Burn address validation, balance checks, state machine
      constraints, checked arithmetic, proper PDA derivation all implemented correctly.
      Advisory: Requires OtterSec/Neodyme audit before mainnet deployment (budgeted in architecture).

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Optimal performance. Integer arithmetic only, minimal overhead (3 divisions for payment splits),
      account sizes optimized, no unbounded operations. No concerns identified.

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Comprehensive error handling with 6 new error codes. State machine prevents invalid transitions.
      Checked arithmetic prevents overflow/underflow panics. Event emission for audit trail.

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent code quality. Clear naming, comprehensive inline docs, consistent patterns,
      proper separation of concerns. Follows Rust/Anchor best practices.
