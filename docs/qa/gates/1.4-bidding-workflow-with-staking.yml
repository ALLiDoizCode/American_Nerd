schema: 1
story: "1.4"
story_title: "Bidding Workflow with Staking"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria met with critical security/reliability refactoring completed during review. Integration tests blocked by prerequisite instructions (expected per story dependencies). Code quality excellent, standards compliant."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Issues found and addressed during review
top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Balance check timing vulnerability - node balance validated AFTER account initialization"
    status: FIXED
    resolution: "Added rent-aware balance validation calculating total required lamports (stake + bid_rent + stake_rent) and validating BEFORE any operations. Uses checked arithmetic to prevent overflow."

  - id: "REL-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Missing message length validation - could cause instruction failure during account init"
    status: FIXED
    resolution: "Added require!(message.len() <= 280) validation at function entry before any state changes."

# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      After refactoring:
      - ✅ Rent-aware balance check prevents partial state
      - ✅ Proper signer validation
      - ✅ Anchor constraints enforce business rules
      - ✅ PDA derivation cryptographically secure
      - ✅ No private key exposure
      Original finding (balance check timing) FIXED during review.

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - ✅ Efficient CPI calls (single system_program::transfer)
      - ✅ Computational complexity acceptable (O(1) exponential/logarithm)
      - ✅ No loops or recursive operations
      - ✅ Account size optimizations (Bid 392 bytes, Stake 111 bytes)

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      After refactoring:
      - ✅ Message length validation prevents initialization failures
      - ✅ Checked arithmetic for rent calculations
      - ✅ Proper error codes defined (6 variants)
      - ✅ Input validation complete (bid amount, message, balance)
      Original finding (missing message validation) FIXED during review.

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - ✅ Clean code structure (errors, instructions, state separation)
      - ✅ Good documentation and comments
      - ✅ Follows Rust/Anchor conventions (rustfmt, clippy clean)
      - ⚠️ Minor: Hardcoded estimated_completion_hours=24 (recommended for parameterization in future story)
