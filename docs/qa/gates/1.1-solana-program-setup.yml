    notes: ".gitignore properly excludes sensitive files (*.pem, *.json.key, id.json, *.env). .env.example provided with no secrets. Wallet path secure (~/.config/solana/id.json). Program ID documented as placeholder."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Cargo release profile optimized (LTO enabled, overflow-checks enabled). Binary size 177KB reasonable for minimal program. No performance bottlenecks."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Program builds successfully without IDL (known Anchor 0.30 nightly feature limitation documented). Build process verified. Tests scaffold created (localnet validation deferred per story scope)."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Program naming consistent (slop_machine). Code formatted per rustfmt. Clippy warning fixed (_ctx). README comprehensive with clear build/test/deploy instructions. Change Log complete."
