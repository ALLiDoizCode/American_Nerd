## The Blockers

### Critical Issues

1. **Arweave Preview URL Costs** ‚ö†Ô∏è SOLVABLE
   - **Problem**: Each PR deployment costs $0.07 (vs. Vercel free)
   - **Solution**: Use Vercel Free Tier for staging, Arweave for production

2. **Akash No Native Preview URLs** ‚ö†Ô∏è SOLVABLE
   - **Problem**: No automatic branch-based preview URLs (breaks "slop or ship" model)
   - **Solution**: Use Railway for staging, Akash for production

3. **Implementation Complexity** ‚ö†Ô∏è MANAGEABLE
   - **Problem**: Crypto wallets, SDL files, manual DNS setup
   - **Solution**: Build deployment abstractions (DevOps AI handles complexity)

**None of these are BLOCKERS** - all have proven workarounds.

## Technology Assessment

### Arweave (Frontend Hosting)

**What It Is**: Permanent decentralized storage with one-time payment model.

**Capabilities**:
- ‚úÖ Next.js static export, React/Vue/Svelte SPAs
- ‚úÖ Turbo SDK for automated deployments via GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ Permanent URLs (200+ year guarantee)
- ‚úÖ Custom domains via CNAME or ArNS
- ‚ùå No SSR, serverless functions, or ISR (static-only)

**Cost Model**:
- **$0.006-0.008/MB** base storage cost
- **+23.4% Turbo SDK service fee**
- **Effective**: ~$0.086 per 10MB deployment
- **Example**: 10MB Next.js app √ó 8 deploys/month = **$0.69/month**

**Best Use Case**: Production frontends with low deployment frequency (weekly or less).

**NOT suitable for**: High-frequency deployments, preview URLs, SSR apps.

### Akash Network (Backend Hosting)

**What It Is**: Decentralized Docker container marketplace with reverse auction pricing.

**Capabilities**:
- ‚úÖ Any Docker-based workload (Node.js, Python, Rust, Go)
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB with persistent storage (SSD/NVMe)
- ‚úÖ 24/7 processes (APIs, AI worker nodes, cron jobs)
- ‚úÖ Custom domains + SSL (via Cloudflare or Caddy)
- ‚ùå No automatic preview URLs (manual per-branch deployments)

**Cost Model**:
- **76-83% cheaper than AWS/GCP/Azure**
- **Reverse auction**: Providers bid for your workload
- **Example**: 500m CPU + 512Mi RAM = **~$3/month** (vs. $10-15 Railway)

**Best Use Case**: Production backends, AI worker nodes, databases (cost-sensitive, 24/7 uptime).

**NOT suitable for**: Teams without crypto expertise, apps requiring preview URLs.

## Critical Findings

### ‚úÖ What Works

1. **Arweave for production frontends**: Permanent hosting, one-time cost, blockchain-native.
2. **Akash for backends + AI nodes**: **MASSIVE cost savings** ($910/month).
3. **Hybrid staging**: Vercel Free + Railway = $0 for unlimited preview URLs.
4. **DevOps automation**: Turbo SDK + Akash CLI = automatable (requires custom tooling).
5. **Full-stack integration**: Arweave frontend ‚Üí Akash backend works (CORS config required).

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work

1. **Arweave preview URLs**: Too expensive ($0.07/deploy √ó 1,800 staging deploys = $155/month).
2. **Akash preview URLs**: No native support (manual SDL per PR = complexity).
3. **Akash SLA**: No uptime guarantees (provider-dependent).

### üéØ The Hybrid Solution

**Use decentralized infrastructure for production** (cost savings + permanence)
**Use centralized infrastructure for staging** (free preview URLs + fast iteration)

This gives us:
- ‚úÖ **63% cost savings** ($820/month)
- ‚úÖ **Free staging environments** (Vercel Free + Railway ephemeral)
- ‚úÖ **Blockchain-native production** (Arweave + Akash + Solana)
- ‚úÖ **Best of both worlds**

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (2 weeks)

**Goal**: Validate Arweave + Akash with real SlopMachine workload.

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Next.js app deployed to Arweave (permanent URL)
- [ ] Node.js API + PostgreSQL deployed to Akash (custom domain)
- [ ] AI worker node running 24/7 on Akash
- [ ] Full-stack integration (Arweave ‚Üí Akash)
- [ ] GitHub Actions automation (build + deploy)
- [ ] Cost tracking (actual vs. estimates)

**Success Criteria**:
- All deployments successful
- Actual costs within 20% of estimates
- No critical performance issues (latency, uptime)
- Team comfortable with complexity

**Go/No-Go Decision**: After PoC, decide to proceed with full migration or stick with centralized.

### Phase 2: Gradual Rollout (10 weeks)

**Week 1**: Infrastructure setup (wallets, CLI, Cloudflare)
**Weeks 2-3**: Build deployment tooling (`@slopmachine/arweave-deployer`, `@slopmachine/akash-deployer`)
**Weeks 3-4**: Pilot with 3 projects (1 frontend, 1 backend, 1 full-stack)
**Weeks 5-8**: Migrate 10 projects/week (gradual rollout)
**Weeks 9-10**: Migrate remaining projects, decommission old infrastructure

**Total Effort**: ~10 dev-weeks (2.5 months of full-time work)

---

## Decision Framework

### ‚úÖ PROCEED with Arweave + Akash IF:

- [ ] **Cost savings justify complexity** (63% savings = $10K/year)
- [ ] **Team has bandwidth** for 10 dev-weeks migration effort
- [ ] **Blockchain-native infrastructure** aligns with SlopMachine's mission
- [ ] **PoC succeeds** (all success criteria met)
- [ ] **Hybrid staging approach** is acceptable (Vercel/Railway for previews)

### ‚ùå REJECT Arweave + Akash IF:

- [ ] **Preview URL costs are non-negotiable** (must be free, must be automatic)
- [ ] **Team lacks crypto/blockchain expertise** (wallets, AKT tokens)
- [ ] **Predictable subscription costs preferred** over crypto volatility
- [ ] **PoC fails** (costs >50% higher, frequent downtime)
- [ ] **Migration effort too high** (team underwater with other priorities)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è REVISIT LATER IF:

- [ ] **Timing not right** (wait until Month 6+ for cost pressure)
- [ ] **Akash roadmap addresses preview URLs** (feature announced)
- [ ] **Arweave reduces upload costs** (Turbo SDK discounts)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Arweave upload costs spiral with frequent deploys** | HIGH | Use Vercel Free for staging, limit Arweave to production |
| **Akash provider downtime (no SLA)** | MEDIUM | Multi-provider redundancy + health check failover |
| **Custom domain complexity (ArNS, DNS)** | MEDIUM | Use Cloudflare proxying (simpler than ArNS) |
| **AKT token volatility** | LOW | Buy AKT in bulk during dips, 76% savings buffer |
| **Team learning curve (crypto/SDL files)** | MEDIUM | Build deployment abstractions (DevOps AI hides complexity) |

## Recommendation

### üéØ **PROCEED WITH HYBRID APPROACH + POC**

**Why**:
1. **Massive cost savings**: $820/month ($10K+/year)
2. **Blockchain-native alignment**: Arweave + Akash + Solana = fully decentralized
3. **Proven workarounds**: Hybrid staging solves preview URL problem
4. **Low-risk PoC**: 2 weeks, <$20 to validate assumptions

**Next Steps**:
1. **Week 1**: Run 2-week PoC (see detailed plan in research doc)
2. **Week 3**: Go/No-Go decision based on PoC results
3. **Weeks 4-13**: Gradual migration (if PoC succeeds)
4. **Month 6**: Full production on Arweave + Akash

**Expected Outcome**: **63% infrastructure cost reduction** + **permanent, decentralized hosting** + **no vendor lock-in**.

## Questions for Team Discussion

1. **Cost vs. Complexity**: Is 63% savings worth 10 dev-weeks migration effort?
2. **Preview URLs**: Is hybrid staging acceptable (Vercel/Railway for staging, Arweave/Akash for production)?
3. **Crypto Expertise**: Does team have bandwidth to learn Arweave wallets, Akash SDL, AKT tokens?
4. **Risk Tolerance**: Comfortable with no-SLA infrastructure (Akash) if multi-provider redundancy?
5. **Timeline**: Can we allocate 2 weeks for PoC in current sprint?
