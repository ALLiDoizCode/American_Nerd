# Story 1.8a: Deploy to Devnet + Integration Test Scaffolding

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status

Done

> **Note:** This story was split from original Story 1.8 by Product Owner decision (2025-10-09) in response to QA gate FAIL. Story 1.8a covers deployment + test scaffolding (scope complete). Story 1.8b will cover missing instruction implementation + full test execution. See Change Log for details.

## Story

**As a** platform developer,
**I want** to deploy the complete Solana program to devnet and create comprehensive integration test scaffolding,
**so that** we have the deployment infrastructure and test framework ready for full integration testing once missing instructions are implemented.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Anchor program deployed to Solana devnet with `anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet`
2. Program ID updated in `Anchor.toml` and `declare_id!` macro with devnet address
3. Integration test scaffolding created with comprehensive test structure covering all planned workflows:
   - Project creation with budget deposit
   - Opportunity creation for story
   - Node registration (3 test nodes: tier 0, tier 5, tier 10)
   - Bid submission with stake lock (all 3 nodes)
   - Opportunity assignment to lowest bidder
   - Work submission with validation pass → payment + stake return
   - Work submission with validation fail → failure count increment
   - Work submission with 3 failures → stake slash
   - Pyth oracle integration on devnet
   - USD amount conversions with live prices
   - Reputation tier progression (10 story completions)
4. Test scaffolding includes proper devnet configuration, wallet funding, and PDA derivation logic
5. Test structure ready for execution once missing instructions (register_node, create_opportunity, accept_bid) are implemented
6. Devnet program address documented in README.md
7. All unit tests continue to pass (67 tests from Stories 1.1-1.7, zero regressions)

## Dev Notes

### Project Overview

Story 1.8 deploys the complete Solana program (Stories 1.1-1.7) to Solana devnet and validates all marketplace functionality through comprehensive integration testing. This is the critical verification step before mainnet deployment (Story 1.9), ensuring:

- Core account structures work correctly (Project, Opportunity, Bid, Work, NodeRegistry, StakeEscrow, SlashEvent)
- Bidding workflow with tier-based staking functions end-to-end
- Payment and stake escrow mechanics operate correctly (lock, release, slash)
- Reputation system calculates tiers accurately and updates on validation outcomes
- Pyth oracle integration provides real-time SOL/USD pricing for USD-denominated bids
- Slashing logic executes correctly (3 failures → 50/50 split to project/burn)

This story focuses on **integration testing** (not unit tests, which already pass from Stories 1.1-1.7). Integration tests use real devnet environment, live Pyth oracle, and actual blockchain transactions to verify multi-instruction workflows.

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.7 completion (Reputation System):
- **Reputation formulas implemented**: `calculate_tier`, `calculate_stake_multiplier`, `calculate_max_story_size`, `calculate_min_absolute_stake`
- **Unit tests passing**: 16 reputation tests + 67 total tests (Stories 1.1-1.7)
- **Integration points**: `update_node_reputation` called from `release_payment_and_stake` (success=true) and `slash_stake_and_refund` (success=false)
- **Key insight**: Integration tests (Story 1.8) will verify these functions work correctly in multi-instruction workflows with real NodeRegistry accounts

From Story 1.6 completion (Pyth Oracle Integration):
- **Manual Pyth parsing**: Zero SDK dependencies, slot-based staleness check (≤75 slots)
- **Helper functions**: `get_sol_price_usd()`, `usd_to_lamports()`, `lamports_to_usd()`
- **Devnet feed**: `J83w4HKfqxwcq3BEMMkPFSppX3gqekLyLJBexebFVkix` (SOL/USD)
- **Minimum bid**: $2.50 USD enforced via oracle conversion
- **Key insight**: Integration tests will use live devnet Pyth feed, not mocked prices

From Story 1.5 completion (Custom Escrow Program Integration):
- **Escrow PDAs**: Project escrow at `["escrow", project_pubkey]`, story escrow at `["story-escrow", opportunity_pubkey]`
- **Release flow**: `release_payment_and_stake` transfers payment + stake to node, updates reputation (completed++, attempted++)
- **Slash flow**: `slash_stake_and_refund` splits 50/50 (project/burn), updates reputation (attempted++ only), creates SlashEvent
- **Key insight**: Integration tests must verify PDA derivation, balance transfers, and cross-instruction state updates

From Story 1.4 completion (Bidding Workflow with Staking):
- **Stake calculation**: `stake_amount = bid_amount × stake_multiplier`
- **Tier-based multipliers**: Now formula-based via `calculate_stake_multiplier()` (Story 1.7)
- **Minimum stake**: Now formula-based via `calculate_min_absolute_stake()` (Story 1.7)
- **Key insight**: Integration tests will verify stake calculations with tier 0, 5, 10 nodes

From Story 1.3 completion (Staking Account Structure):
- **StakeEscrow account**: Includes `node_tier` (tier at bid time), `slash_count` (triggers at 3+)
- **SlashEvent account**: Records slashed amounts with 50/50 split details
- **Key insight**: Integration tests must verify `slash_count` increments and SlashEvent creation

From Story 1.2 completion (Core Account Structures):
- **Account discriminators**: All accounts use Anchor discriminators for type safety
- **Serialization**: All accounts tested for serialize/deserialize (unit tests)
- **Key insight**: Integration tests will use actual on-chain accounts, not mock structs

From Story 1.1 completion (Solana Program Setup):
- **Anchor 0.31.1**: Project initialized, builds successfully
- **Test scaffold**: Basic deployment test exists in `packages/programs/tests/slop-machine.spec.ts`
- **Key insight**: Integration tests will extend existing test infrastructure

### Architecture Context

**Deployment Strategy** [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#deployment-strategy]:

Slop Machine uses a three-environment deployment pipeline:
1. **Local (Anchor localnet)**: Unit tests and rapid development
2. **Devnet**: Integration testing with real blockchain (Story 1.8)
3. **Mainnet-beta**: Production deployment (Story 1.9)

**Devnet Deployment Process**:
```bash
# 1. Generate program keypair
solana-keygen new -o target/deploy/slop_machine-keypair.json

# 2. Get devnet SOL (repeat as needed for 10+ SOL)
solana airdrop 5 --url devnet

# 3. Build and deploy
anchor build
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet

# 4. Sync IDL
anchor idl init <PROGRAM_ID> --filepath target/idl/slop_machine.json --provider.cluster devnet

# 5. Update program IDs
# Edit Anchor.toml: [programs.devnet] slop_machine = "<PROGRAM_ID>"
# Edit src/lib.rs: declare_id!("<PROGRAM_ID>")

# 6. Rebuild and verify
anchor build
solana program show <PROGRAM_ID> --url devnet
```

**Integration Test Configuration** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]:

Integration tests use:
- **Framework**: Anchor's built-in test framework (`anchor test`)
- **Cluster**: Devnet (real blockchain, not local validator)
- **Pyth Oracle**: Live devnet price feed (not mocked)
- **Wallets**: Test keypairs funded via devnet faucet
- **Coverage**: Complete workflows (multi-instruction sequences)

**Test Infrastructure Setup**:
```typescript
// packages/programs/tests/devnet-integration.spec.ts
import * as anchor from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Program } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { SlopMachine } from "../target/types/slop_machine";
import { Keypair, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL } from "@solana/web3.js";

describe("devnet-integration", () => {
  // Configure devnet cluster (not localnet)
  const provider = anchor.AnchorProvider.env();
  anchor.setProvider(provider);
  const program = anchor.workspace.SlopMachine as Program<SlopMachine>;

  // Test fixtures: 3 node keypairs, project creator keypair
  let projectCreator: Keypair;
  let tier0Node: Keypair;
  let tier5Node: Keypair;
  let tier10Node: Keypair;

  before(async () => {
    // Generate test keypairs
    projectCreator = Keypair.generate();
    tier0Node = Keypair.generate();
    tier5Node = Keypair.generate();
    tier10Node = Keypair.generate();

    // Fund wallets via devnet faucet (2 SOL each)
    await requestAirdrop(provider.connection, projectCreator.publicKey, 2 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL);
    await requestAirdrop(provider.connection, tier0Node.publicKey, 2 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL);
    await requestAirdrop(provider.connection, tier5Node.publicKey, 2 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL);
    await requestAirdrop(provider.connection, tier10Node.publicKey, 2 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL);
  });

  // ... test cases
});
```

**Pyth Oracle Devnet Configuration** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#pyth-network-oracle-api]:

- **Devnet SOL/USD Feed**: `J83w4HKfqxwcq3BEMMkPFSppX3gqekLyLJBexebFVkix`
- **Update Frequency**: ~400ms (real-time on-chain updates)
- **Staleness Check**: Reject if price older than 75 slots (~30 seconds)
- **Integration Test Usage**: Tests will use live feed, not mocked prices

**Example Oracle Test**:
```typescript
it("fetches live SOL/USD price from Pyth devnet", async () => {
  const pythFeedDevnet = new PublicKey("J83w4HKfqxwcq3BEMMkPFSppX3gqekLyLJBexebFVkix");

  // Fetch price via program helper function
  const price = await program.methods
    .getSolPriceUsd()
    .accounts({ pythFeed: pythFeedDevnet })
    .view();

  // Verify price is reasonable (e.g., $20-$500)
  expect(price).toBeGreaterThan(20_00); // $20 USD (cents)
  expect(price).toBeLessThan(500_00);   // $500 USD (cents)

  console.log(`Live SOL/USD price: $${price / 100}`);
});
```

**Reputation Tier Progression Testing** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#noderegistry-infinite-tier-progression-formulas]:

Integration tests must verify reputation formulas work correctly in real workflows:

```typescript
it("progresses tier 0 node to tier 3 after 10 successful stories", async () => {
  // Initial state: tier 0 (0 completed, 0 attempted)
  let nodeRegistry = await program.account.nodeRegistry.fetch(tier0NodePDA);
  expect(nodeRegistry.reputationTier).toBe(0);
  expect(nodeRegistry.stakeMultiplierBasisPoints).toBe(500); // 5.0x

  // Complete 10 stories successfully
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // Create opportunity, bid, accept, submit work, validate pass
    await createAndCompleteStory(tier0Node, projectCreator, program);

    // Fetch updated reputation
    nodeRegistry = await program.account.nodeRegistry.fetch(tier0NodePDA);
    console.log(`Story ${i+1}: completed=${nodeRegistry.projectsCompleted}, tier=${nodeRegistry.reputationTier}`);
  }

  // Final state: tier 3 (10 completed, 10 attempted)
  // Formula: tier = floor(sqrt(10) * 1.0) = floor(3.16) = 3
  expect(nodeRegistry.projectsCompleted).toBe(10);
  expect(nodeRegistry.projectsAttempted).toBe(10);
  expect(nodeRegistry.reputationTier).toBe(3);

  // Stake multiplier should be ~2.64x (Story 1.7 formula)
  // 5.0 * exp(-0.15 * 3) = 3.1836... → 318 basis points → stake 3.18x (not 2.64x, formula is exponential)
  expect(nodeRegistry.stakeMultiplierBasisPoints).toBeGreaterThan(300);
  expect(nodeRegistry.stakeMultiplierBasisPoints).toBeLessThan(330);

  // Max story size should be $13 (tier 3)
  // Formula: 5.0 * 1.4^3 = 13.72 → $13 whole dollars → 1300 cents
  expect(nodeRegistry.maxStorySizeUsd).toBe(1300); // $13.00 in cents
});
```

**Slashing Flow Integration Test** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#stakeescrow]:

Integration tests must verify slashing logic executes correctly:

```typescript
it("slashes stake after 3 validation failures (50/50 split)", async () => {
  // Setup: Create opportunity, accept tier 0 node bid
  const opportunity = await createOpportunity(projectCreator, 500_000_000); // $5 @ $100/SOL
  const bid = await submitBid(tier0Node, opportunity, 500_000_000); // $5 bid, $25 stake (5x)
  await acceptBid(projectCreator, bid);

  // Submit work and fail validation 3 times
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    await submitWork(tier0Node, opportunity, `mock-arweave-tx-${i}`);
    await simulateValidationFailure(opportunity);
  }

  // Check slash_count before slashing
  let stakeEscrow = await program.account.stakeEscrow.fetch(stakeEscrowPDA);
  expect(stakeEscrow.slashCount).toBe(3);

  // Execute slash instruction
  const projectEscrowBefore = await provider.connection.getBalance(projectEscrowPDA);
  const burnAddressBefore = await provider.connection.getBalance(BURN_ADDRESS);

  await program.methods
    .slashStakeAndRefund()
    .accounts({
      opportunity: opportunity,
      stakeEscrow: stakeEscrowPDA,
      nodeRegistry: tier0NodeRegistryPDA,
      projectEscrow: projectEscrowPDA,
      burnAddress: BURN_ADDRESS,
    })
    .rpc();

  // Verify 50/50 split
  const projectEscrowAfter = await provider.connection.getBalance(projectEscrowPDA);
  const burnAddressAfter = await provider.connection.getBalance(BURN_ADDRESS);

  const stakeAmount = 2_500_000_000; // $25 @ $100/SOL (5x multiplier)
  const halfStake = stakeAmount / 2;

  expect(projectEscrowAfter - projectEscrowBefore).toBe(halfStake); // 50% to project
  expect(burnAddressAfter - burnAddressBefore).toBe(halfStake);    // 50% burned

  // Verify payment returned to project escrow
  // (payment was 500_000_000, now back in project escrow)

  // Verify reputation updated (attempted++ only, completed unchanged)
  const nodeRegistry = await program.account.nodeRegistry.fetch(tier0NodeRegistryPDA);
  expect(nodeRegistry.projectsCompleted).toBe(0); // Unchanged
  expect(nodeRegistry.projectsAttempted).toBe(1); // Incremented

  // Verify tier remains 0 (0 completed / 1 attempted = 0% success rate → tier 0)
  expect(nodeRegistry.reputationTier).toBe(0);

  // Verify SlashEvent created
  const slashEvent = await program.account.slashEvent.fetch(slashEventPDA);
  expect(slashEvent.slashedAmount).toBe(stakeAmount);
  expect(slashEvent.toProject).toBe(halfStake);
  expect(slashEvent.burned).toBe(halfStake);
  expect(slashEvent.reason).toBe("3+ consecutive validation failures");
});
```

# Devnet Integration Test Results

**Test Date:** 2025-10-09
**Program ID:** <DEVNET_PROGRAM_ID>
**Solana Cluster:** Devnet
**Test Duration:** 4 minutes 32 seconds

## 1. Successful Payment Flow

### Test Scenario
Opportunity created → Bid submitted → Work validated → Payment + stake released

### Transaction Signatures
- Project creation: `<TX_SIG_1>`
- Opportunity creation: `<TX_SIG_2>`
- Bid submission: `<TX_SIG_3>`
- Work submission: `<TX_SIG_4>`
- Payment release: `<TX_SIG_5>`

### Account Balances (Before/After)
- Node wallet: 2.0 SOL → 2.045 SOL (+0.045 SOL = $4 payment + $0.448 stake)
- Project escrow: 1.0 SOL → 0.955 SOL (-0.045 SOL = payment out)

### Reputation Update
- Tier 10 node: 100 completed → 101 completed, 100 attempted → 101 attempted
- Tier remains 10 (sqrt(101) * 1.0 = 10.04 → floor = 10)

## 2. Successful Slashing Flow

### Test Scenario
3 validation failures → Stake slashed → SlashEvent created

### Transaction Signatures
- Failure 1: `<TX_SIG_6>`
- Failure 2: `<TX_SIG_7>`
- Failure 3: `<TX_SIG_8>`
- Slash execution: `<TX_SIG_9>`

### Slash Distribution
- Total stake: 2.5 SOL ($25 @ $100/SOL, 5x multiplier)
- To project escrow: 1.25 SOL (50%)
- To burn address: 1.25 SOL (50%)

### Reputation Degradation
- Tier 0 node: 0 completed (unchanged), 0 attempted → 1 attempted
- Tier remains 0 (0/1 = 0% success rate → tier 0)

## 3. Reputation Progression

### Test Scenario
10 successful story completions → Tier 0 to Tier 3 progression

### Progression Table
| Story | Completed | Attempted | Success Rate | Tier | Stake Multiplier |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------------|------|------------------|
| 0     | 0         | 0         | N/A          | 0    | 5.00x            |
| 1     | 1         | 1         | 100%         | 1    | 4.30x            |
| 2     | 2         | 2         | 100%         | 1    | 4.30x            |
| 3     | 3         | 3         | 100%         | 1    | 4.30x            |
| 4     | 4         | 4         | 100%         | 2    | 3.70x            |
| 5     | 5         | 5         | 100%         | 2    | 3.70x            |
| 6     | 6         | 6         | 100%         | 2    | 3.70x            |
| 7     | 7         | 7         | 100%         | 2    | 3.70x            |
| 8     | 8         | 8         | 100%         | 2    | 3.70x            |
| 9     | 9         | 9         | 100%         | 3    | 3.18x            |
| 10    | 10        | 10        | 100%         | 3    | 3.18x            |

### Final State
- Tier: 3 (sqrt(10) * 1.0 = 3.16 → floor = 3)
- Stake multiplier: 3.18x (5.0 * exp(-0.15 * 3) = 3.1836)
- Max story size: $13 (5.0 * 1.4^3 = 13.72 → floor = $13)

## 4. Oracle Price Conversions

### Live Pyth Data
- SOL/USD price: $142.35
- Confidence interval: ±$0.12
- Update slot: 285443892 (current slot: 285443895, staleness: 3 slots ✅)

### Conversion Examples
- $5 USD → 0.0351 SOL (35,130,419 lamports)
- 0.5 SOL → $71.18 USD (7118 cents)
- Minimum bid $2.50 → 0.0176 SOL (17,565,210 lamports)

### Validation Tests
- ✅ Bid below $2.50 rejected (error: BidBelowMinimumUSD)
- ✅ Stale price (76+ slots) rejected (error: OraclePriceStale)

---

**All Tests Passed** ✅ (8/8 test scenarios)
```

### Testing Requirements

**Test Framework**: Anchor integration tests (TypeScript)
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]

**Test File Locations**:
- Integration tests: `packages/programs/tests/devnet-integration.spec.ts` (new file)
- Test results: `packages/programs/tests/devnet-test-results.md` (new documentation)

**Test Infrastructure**:
- Cluster: Solana devnet (not localnet)
- Pyth Oracle: Live devnet feed `J83w4HKfqxwcq3BEMMkPFSppX3gqekLyLJBexebFVkix`
- Wallets: Test keypairs funded via `solana airdrop` (2 SOL each)
- Test accounts: 3 node keypairs (tier 0, 5, 10), 1 project creator keypair

**Test Execution**:
```bash
# Run devnet integration tests (skip rebuild)
anchor test --provider.cluster devnet --skip-build

# Run with verbose output
RUST_LOG=debug anchor test --provider.cluster devnet --skip-build

# Run specific test file
anchor test --provider.cluster devnet --skip-build --test devnet-integration
```

**Test Coverage Goals**:
- ✅ All 9 acceptance criteria covered by integration tests
- ✅ Complete workflows tested (multi-instruction sequences)
- ✅ Live devnet environment (no mocks for blockchain state)
- ✅ Real Pyth oracle integration (live price feeds)
- ✅ Edge cases: Minimum bid validation, stale price rejection, 3-failure slashing

**Test Standards**:
- Use `expect()` assertions (chai library)
- Include transaction signatures in test results documentation
- Verify account balances before/after each operation
- Log reputation progression at each step for debugging
- Test execution time should be < 5 minutes (devnet RPC latency)

### Coding Standards Compliance

**TypeScript Standards:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#core-standards]
- Use ESLint with `@typescript-eslint/recommended` configuration
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Follow camelCase for function names (createOpportunity, submitBid)
- Use PascalCase for type names (SlopMachine, NodeRegistry)

**Integration Test Standards:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]
- No mocking of blockchain state (use real accounts)
- Mock external services only if unavoidable (not needed for Story 1.8)
- Use descriptive test names (e.g., "slashes stake after 3 consecutive failures")
- Include setup/teardown logic in `before()` and `after()` hooks
- Verify state changes using account fetches, not assumptions

**Critical Rules:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- ✅ All blockchain transactions MUST be simulated before submission (Anchor does this automatically)
- ✅ PDAs MUST be derived using proper seeds, never hardcoded (use `PublicKey.findProgramAddress()`)
- ✅ Private keys MUST never be logged or exposed (use `Keypair.generate()` for test wallets)
- ✅ All async operations MUST have timeouts (Anchor configures default 60s timeout)

### Integration with Future Stories

**Story 1.9: Deploy to Mainnet-Beta**
- Will use same deployment process as Story 1.8 (devnet → mainnet)
- Will update program IDs in `Anchor.toml` and `lib.rs` for mainnet
- Will configure mainnet Pyth feed: `H6ARHf6YXhGYeQfUzQNGk6rDNnLBQKrenN712K4AQJEG`
- Will run smoke tests on mainnet with real SOL (small amounts)

**Epic 2: Story Workflow**
- Will build on top of devnet-deployed program (Story 1.8)
- Will use devnet for Epic 2 development and testing
- Will deploy Epic 2 changes to devnet before mainnet

**Epic 3: AI Node Core**
- Will use devnet program for AI node development
- Will subscribe to devnet events for opportunity notifications
- Will submit bids and work to devnet program for testing

### Dependencies and Imports

Integration tests require:
```typescript
import * as anchor from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Program } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { SlopMachine } from "../target/types/slop_machine";
import { Keypair, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL, PublicKey, SystemProgram } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { expect } from "chai";
```

No new program dependencies (all Stories 1.1-1.7 dependencies already configured).

### No Specific Guidance Found

**Frontend/UI:** No frontend components (this is backend-only story)

**MCP Integration:** No MCP server changes (integration tests only)

**Social Integration:** No social media integration (blockchain testing only)

### Security Considerations

**Devnet Security** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]:

1. **Test Wallet Management (CRITICAL)**:
   - Use `Keypair.generate()` for test wallets (never use real wallets)
   - Never commit keypair files to git (add `*.json` to `.gitignore`)
   - Test wallets funded via devnet faucet (free devnet SOL, not real SOL)
   - Devnet SOL has no value (safe to experiment)

2. **Private Key Handling**:
   - Never log private keys in test output
   - Store test keypairs in memory only (no file persistence)
   - Use environment variables for deployment keypair (if needed)

3. **Program Deployment**:
   - Use unique program ID for devnet (never reuse mainnet IDs)
   - Verify program authority is test wallet (not production wallet)
   - Test upgrade authority works correctly (for future upgrades)

4. **Integration Test Safety**:
   - Tests use real blockchain transactions (devnet only)
   - Verify all test accounts created during tests are closed afterward (rent reclamation)
   - Monitor devnet SOL balances to detect unexpected spending

**Critical Security Rules**:
```typescript
// GOOD: Generate test keypairs in code
const tier0Node = Keypair.generate();

// BAD: Never load real wallet keypairs in tests
const productionWallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(realPrivateKey); // ❌ NEVER DO THIS

// GOOD: Use devnet cluster
const connection = new Connection("https://api.devnet.solana.com");

// BAD: Never use mainnet in tests
const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"); // ❌ NEVER DO THIS

// GOOD: Log public keys only
console.log(`Node wallet: ${tier0Node.publicKey.toBase58()}`);

// BAD: Never log private keys
console.log(`Private key: ${tier0Node.secretKey}`); // ❌ NEVER DO THIS
```

### Testing

**Test File Locations:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Integration tests: `packages/programs/tests/devnet-integration.spec.ts` (new file)
- Test results: `packages/programs/tests/devnet-test-results.md` (new documentation)
- Run with: `anchor test --provider.cluster devnet --skip-build`

**Test Standards**:
- All 9 acceptance criteria must have corresponding integration tests
- Test coverage: 100% of AC (not code coverage percentage)
- Test execution time: < 5 minutes (devnet RPC latency)
- Test pass rate: 100% (all tests must pass before marking story Done)

**Test Execution**:
```bash
# Step 1: Deploy to devnet first
anchor build
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet

# Step 2: Update program IDs (Anchor.toml, lib.rs)

# Step 3: Run integration tests
anchor test --provider.cluster devnet --skip-build

# Step 4: Document results
# Copy test output to packages/programs/tests/devnet-test-results.md
```

### Debug Log References

(To be populated during implementation)

### Completion Notes

**Deployment Summary:**
- Successfully deployed Slop Machine program to Solana devnet
- Program ID: `4hPgUuR7S8pyX7WxgaKTunaPCjMQLhEmBgQEyTrTvDNt`
- Deployed at slot: 413451864
- IDL synced to devnet (IDL account: J4e2WUJiXEWUGoz34opjkXw1rPtKX4AavyJo8ixp83SB)
- Program verified on devnet explorer

**Integration Test Suite:**
- Created comprehensive devnet integration test suite (`tests/devnet-integration.spec.ts`)
- 10 test suites covering all 9 acceptance criteria
- Includes helper functions for devnet airdrop with retry logic
- Tests structured to run on devnet (not localnet)

**Unit Test Results:**
- All 67 unit tests passed (Stories 1.1-1.7)
- No regressions introduced
- Program ready for integration testing on devnet

**Documentation Updates:**
- Updated `packages/programs/README.md` with devnet deployment instructions
- Added devnet program ID and explorer link
- Documented integration test execution commands

**Note on Integration Tests:**
The devnet integration tests in `tests/devnet-integration.spec.ts` are currently structured as scaffolding with many tests marked as `.skip()`. This is because several prerequisite instructions (create_opportunity, register_node, accept_bid) are not yet fully implemented in the program. These tests serve as a comprehensive specification for future work and will be enabled as the corresponding instructions are implemented in subsequent stories.

The tests that ARE functional:
- Project creation with escrow deposit (AC #3, Test 1)
- Pyth oracle account verification (AC #4, Test 2)
- Devnet environment setup with wallet funding

**Blocked/Pending Work:**
- Full integration test execution requires completing Epic 1 Stories 1.1-1.7 instruction implementations
- Some integration tests will need to be unblocked once node registration, opportunity creation, and bidding instructions are fully connected end-to-end

### File List

**Modified Files:**
- `packages/programs/Anchor.toml` - Updated devnet program ID
- `packages/programs/programs/slop-machine/src/lib.rs` - Updated declare_id! with devnet program ID
- `packages/programs/README.md` - Added devnet deployment documentation and program ID

**New Files:**
- `packages/programs/tests/devnet-integration.spec.ts` - Comprehensive devnet integration test suite (754 lines)

**Deployed Artifacts:**
- Program: `4hPgUuR7S8pyX7WxgaKTunaPCjMQLhEmBgQEyTrTvDNt` (Devnet)
- IDL Account: `J4e2WUJiXEWUGoz34opjkXw1rPtKX4AavyJo8ixp83SB` (Devnet)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** Story 1.8 represents a **partial completion** of the devnet deployment and integration testing requirements. The work completed demonstrates strong technical foundation with successful devnet deployment, comprehensive test scaffolding, and proper documentation. However, the story is **blocked by missing prerequisite instructions** that prevent full integration test execution.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Successful Devnet Deployment**: Program deployed to devnet (ID: `4hPgUuR7S8pyX7WxgaKTunaPCjMQLhEmBgQEyTrTvDNt`) with proper IDL sync
- ✅ **Comprehensive Test Suite Structure**: 500-line integration test suite with 10 test suites covering all 9 acceptance criteria
- ✅ **Unit Test Stability**: All 67 unit tests passing (Stories 1.1-1.7), zero regressions
- ✅ **Documentation Excellence**: README.md updated with devnet deployment instructions, program ID, and explorer link
- ✅ **Test Infrastructure Quality**: Devnet airdrop helper with retry logic, proper PDA derivation, wallet setup
- ✅ **Pyth Oracle Verification**: Live devnet Pyth feed validated (AC #4 partially met)

**Critical Blockers:**
- ❌ **Missing Instructions**: `register_node`, `create_opportunity`, `accept_bid` not yet implemented
- ❌ **Test Execution**: 32+ integration tests marked as `.skip()` due to missing instructions
- ❌ **Incomplete AC Coverage**: Only 2 of 9 acceptance criteria fully met (AC #1, #2 deployment; AC #4 Pyth feed exists)

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring performed** - This review focused on assessment only, as the primary issue is missing instruction implementations (not code quality).

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ TypeScript follows ESLint/Prettier, proper naming conventions (camelCase functions, PascalCase types)
- **Project Structure**: ✅ Files in correct locations (`tests/devnet-integration.spec.ts`, updated `Anchor.toml`, `lib.rs`)
- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠️ **CONCERNS** - Test scaffold excellent, but execution blocked by missing instructions
- **All ACs Met**: ❌ **FAIL** - Only 2 of 9 acceptance criteria fully met

### Requirements Traceability (AC → Tests)

| AC # | Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Deploy to devnet with `anchor deploy` | Manual verification | ✅ **PASS** |
| 2 | Update program IDs in Anchor.toml + lib.rs | Manual verification | ✅ **PASS** |
| 3 | Integration test suite (8 scenarios) | 10 test suites (32 tests, mostly `.skip()`) | ❌ **BLOCKED** |
| 4 | Pyth oracle integration tested on devnet | Pyth feed existence validated | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** |
| 5 | USD conversions tested with real prices | Not executable (missing instructions) | ❌ **BLOCKED** |
| 6 | Reputation tier progression tested | Test scaffolding exists (`.skip()`) | ❌ **BLOCKED** |
| 7 | All integration tests pass on devnet | Cannot execute (missing instructions) | ❌ **BLOCKED** |
| 8 | Test results documented | Not created (tests cannot run) | ❌ **BLOCKED** |
| 9 | Devnet program address documented | ✅ README.md updated | ✅ **PASS** |

**Summary:** 2 of 9 ACs fully met (22%), 1 partial (11%), 6 blocked (67%)

### Blocking Conditions Analysis

**This story is BLOCKED by missing prerequisite implementations:**

1. **Missing Instructions** (Priority: CRITICAL):
   - `register_node` (required for AC #3, Tests 3-9)
   - `create_opportunity` (required for AC #3-8, Tests 2-9)
   - `accept_bid` (required for AC #3-8, Tests 5-9)

2. **Impact on Test Execution**:
   - **Tests 1-2**: ✅ Executable (project escrow + Pyth validation)
   - **Tests 3-10**: ❌ Blocked (32 tests marked `.skip()`)
   - **Overall Test Pass Rate**: 2/34 tests executable (6%)

3. **Scope Clarification Needed**:
   - Does Story 1.8 include implementing missing instructions?
   - OR is Story 1.8 only "deploy existing code + create test scaffolding"?

**Current interpretation:** Based on Dev Notes stating "This test will be enabled as corresponding instructions are implemented in subsequent stories," the developer correctly interpreted Story 1.8 as **scaffolding-only**. However, the story AC #7 ("All integration tests pass on devnet") **cannot be met** with this interpretation.

### Gate Status

**Gate**: ❌ **FAIL** → `docs/qa/gates/1.8-deploy-to-devnet-comprehensive-testing.yml`

**Reason:** Critical acceptance criteria not met (AC #3-8 blocked by missing instructions), integration tests cannot execute.

### Recommended Status

❌ **Changes Required** - Story cannot be marked "Done" due to blocked acceptance criteria.

**Resolution Options:**

**Option 1: Split Story** (Recommended)
- Mark Story 1.8 as "Partial" with current scope: Deployment + Test Scaffolding
- Create Story 1.8b: "Implement Missing Instructions + Execute Integration Tests"
- Update AC #3-8 to Story 1.8b

**Option 2: Expand Story 1.8**
- Implement `register_node`, `create_opportunity`, `accept_bid` instructions
- Enable all integration tests (remove `.skip()`)
- Execute tests and document results (AC #8)
- Estimated: +16-24 dev hours

**Option 3: Reinterpret ACs**
- Change AC #3-8 to "scaffolding created" instead of "tests pass"
- Accept current state as complete
- Requires Product Owner approval to waive AC #7

### Security Review

**Devnet Security:** ✅ **PASS**
- Test wallets use `Keypair.generate()` (no real keys exposed)
- Devnet cluster correctly configured (not mainnet)
- No private key logging in test code
- Proper wallet funding via devnet faucet (rate-limited with retry logic)

**Program Deployment Security:** ✅ **PASS**
- Program ID correctly updated in `Anchor.toml` and `lib.rs`
- IDL synced to devnet (separate IDL account)
- No hardcoded secrets or mainnet keys

### Performance Considerations

**Test Execution Time:** ⚠️ **CONCERNS**
- **Airdrop delays**: 1-second delays between airdrop requests (devnet rate limit mitigation)
- **Estimated full test runtime**: 4-6 minutes (when unblocked)
- **Recommendation**: Consider using pre-funded test wallets for CI/CD to reduce setup time

**Devnet RPC Latency:** ✅ **ACCEPTABLE**
- Tests use public devnet RPC (potential rate limits)
- Recommendation: Configure Helius/Alchemy devnet RPC for production testing

### Files Modified During Review

**No files modified** - This was an assessment-only review.

- [ ] Configure Helius/Alchemy devnet RPC for rate limit avoidance
- [ ] Add test result screenshots/TX explorer links to documentation
- [ ] Create GitHub Action for automated devnet testing

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

**Security:** ✅ **PASS**
- No secrets exposed, devnet-only configuration, proper key management

**Performance:** ⚠️ **CONCERNS**
- Test setup time potentially long (airdrop delays), recommend pre-funded wallets

**Reliability:** ⚠️ **CONCERNS**
- Devnet faucet rate limits may cause test flakiness, retry logic mitigates but doesn't eliminate

**Maintainability:** ✅ **PASS**
- Excellent code structure, clear test descriptions, comprehensive comments, proper TypeScript types

### Technical Debt Identified

1. **Missing Instructions** (Priority: CRITICAL, Cost: High)
   - **Debt:** Core instructions not implemented, blocking Story 1.8 completion
   - **Impact:** Cannot execute integration tests, cannot verify AC #3-8
   - **Recommendation:** Prioritize implementing `register_node`, `create_opportunity`, `accept_bid` in next sprint

2. **Test Scaffold vs. Execution Gap** (Priority: HIGH, Cost: Medium)
   - **Debt:** 32 integration tests scaffolded but not executable (94% of tests)
   - **Impact:** False sense of completion, actual test coverage unknown
   - **Recommendation:** Track as separate story or expand Story 1.8 scope

3. **Devnet Test Results Documentation Missing** (Priority: MEDIUM, Cost: Low)
   - **Debt:** AC #8 requires `devnet-test-results.md`, not created (tests cannot run)
   - **Impact:** No evidence of successful payment/slashing/reputation flows
   - **Recommendation:** Generate documentation once tests are executable

4. **Airdrop Delays in Test Setup** (Priority: LOW, Cost: Low)
   - **Debt:** 6-second sequential airdrop delays in `before()` hook
   - **Impact:** Slow test startup, potential CI/CD timeout issues
   - **Recommendation:** Pre-fund test wallets or parallelize airdrops with rate limit backoff

### Quality Score

**Score:** 42/100

**Calculation:**
- Base: 100
- AC Coverage: -30 (6 of 9 ACs blocked/failed)
- Test Execution: -20 (94% of tests not executable)
- Missing Documentation: -8 (devnet-test-results.md not created)
- **Positives:**
  - +0 (deployment successful, scaffolding excellent, but baseline expectations)

**Interpretation:** Low score reflects **scope ambiguity** rather than poor quality. Deliverables are high quality, but story requirements cannot be met without additional work.

### Recommendations for Product Owner

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Clarify Story Scope** (Decision Required):
   - Is Story 1.8 intended to be "deployment + scaffolding" OR "deployment + fully executable tests"?
   - Current AC #7 ("All integration tests pass") cannot be met without implementing missing instructions

2. **Choose Resolution Path** (Decision Required):
   - **Path A (Recommended):** Split story, mark Story 1.8 as "Partial - Scaffolding Complete"
   - **Path B:** Expand Story 1.8 to include missing instruction implementations (+16-24 hours)
   - **Path C:** Waive AC #3-8, accept scaffolding as complete (requires explicit approval)

3. **Update Epic 1 Roadmap**:
   - If missing instructions are in other stories, create dependency graph
   - If not planned, add Story 1.8b to Epic 1

### Recommendations for Development Team

**Short-Term (Next Sprint):**

1. **Prioritize Missing Instructions**:
   - Implement `register_node` (Story 1.3 dependency?)
   - Implement `create_opportunity` (Story 1.4 dependency?)
   - Implement `accept_bid` (Story 1.4 dependency?)

2. **Enable Integration Tests**:
   - Remove `.skip()` from 32 tests once instructions implemented
   - Execute full test suite on devnet
   - Document results in `tests/devnet-test-results.md`

3. **Verify AC Compliance**:
   - Re-run QA review after instructions implemented
   - Ensure AC #7 ("All integration tests pass") is met

**Long-Term (Post-Epic 1):**

1. **Improve Test Infrastructure**:
   - Add pre-funded test wallet support for CI/CD
   - Configure Helius/Alchemy devnet RPC
   - Add automated devnet testing to GitHub Actions

2. **Documentation**:
   - Create test result screenshots/TX explorer links
   - Document integration test execution best practices

### Story Owner Decision Required

This story **cannot proceed to "Done"** without addressing the missing instruction blocker. Please choose:

- [ ] **Option 1:** Split story (Story 1.8a complete, Story 1.8b for execution)
- [ ] **Option 2:** Expand Story 1.8 scope to include missing instructions
- [ ] **Option 3:** Waive AC #3-8 and accept scaffolding as complete

**Quinn's Recommendation:** Option 1 (split story) to unblock current work while planning instruction implementations.
