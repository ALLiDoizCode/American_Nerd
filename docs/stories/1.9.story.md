# Story 1.9: Deploy to Mainnet-Beta

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status

On Hold - Awaiting Funding

## Story

**As a** platform developer,
**I want** to deploy the Solana program to mainnet-beta and verify it works with real SOL,
**so that** the Slop Machine marketplace can operate in production.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Mainnet deployment checklist completed:
   - All devnet tests passing
   - Security audit considerations documented
   - Upgrade authority configuration reviewed
   - Emergency pause mechanism reviewed (if applicable)
2. Anchor program deployed to mainnet-beta with `anchor deploy --provider.cluster mainnet`
3. Program ID updated in `Anchor.toml` and `declare_id!` macro with mainnet address
4. Pyth oracle mainnet price feed address configured
5. Smoke test on mainnet with real SOL (small amounts):
   - Create test project with 0.1 SOL budget
   - Create test opportunity for $5 story
   - Register test node (tier 0)
   - Submit bid with stake (0.025 SOL bid + 0.125 SOL stake @ 5x multiplier)
   - Simulate validation pass → verify payment + stake return
6. All smoke tests pass on mainnet
7. Mainnet program address published in README.md and docs/architecture.md
8. Mainnet deployment announced (Twitter, Discord, etc.)
9. Program verified on Solana Explorer (solscan.io or solana.fm)
10. Monitoring configured for program activity (transaction counts, errors)

## Dev Notes

### Project Overview

Story 1.9 completes Epic 1 (Blockchain Foundation) by deploying the fully-tested Solana program from devnet to mainnet-beta. This is the final step to enable production use of the Slop Machine marketplace.

### Prerequisites from Story 1.8b

Story 1.8b completed all devnet testing and QA review:
- ✅ 71 unit tests passing (100% of implemented modules)
- ✅ 7 integration tests passing (core functionality verified)
- ✅ Devnet deployment stable (Program ID: `4hPgUuR7S8pyX7WxgaKTunaPCjMQLhEmBgQEyTrTvDNt`)
- ✅ All acceptance criteria validated on devnet
- ✅ QA gate PASS with quality score 90/100

Story 1.9 will:
- Deploy the same program codebase to mainnet
- Update configuration for mainnet (Pyth feeds, program IDs)
- Execute smoke tests with real SOL
- Verify deployment and announce to community

### Architecture Context

**Deployment Strategy** [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#deployment-strategy]:

The Slop Machine uses blue/green deployment via Anchor's program upgrade mechanism:
- Programs are upgradeable via upgrade authority (deployer wallet)
- Deployment promotes from devnet → mainnet after testing
- Rollback capability via `anchor upgrade` with previous version

**Environments** [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#environments]:

Three environments exist:
1. **Local Development**: `solana-test-validator` for rapid iteration
2. **Devnet (Staging)**: `https://api.devnet.solana.com` for integration testing
3. **Mainnet-Beta (Production)**: Helius RPC `${HELIUS_RPC_URL}` for production

**Environment Promotion Flow** [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#environment-promotion-flow]:

```
Local Development
    ↓ (git push to feature branch)
Devnet Testing
    ↓ (PR merge to main)
Automated Devnet Deployment
    ↓ (Manual approval + testing)
Mainnet Deployment  ← Story 1.9 executes this step
    ↓ (Monitor + rollback if needed)
Production Stable
```

**Rollback Strategy** [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#rollback-strategy]:

Mainnet rollback triggers:
- Transaction failure rate >10%
- Critical bug discovered in production
- Escrow payment issues
- Data corruption or account state errors

Recovery Time Objective: <30 minutes for smart contracts

**Pyth Oracle Mainnet Configuration** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#pyth-network-oracle-api]:

Mainnet Pyth SOL/USD price feed:
- Address: `H6ARHf6YXhGYeQfUzQNGk6rDNnLBQKrenN712K4AQJEG`
- Update frequency: ~400ms on-chain
- Confidence intervals available for risk assessment

Devnet Pyth SOL/USD price feed (currently configured):
- Address: `J83w4HKfqxwcq3BEMMkPFSppX3gqekLyLJBexebFVkix`

**Oracle Helper Function Update Pattern:**

The oracle helper functions need to be updated to support both devnet and mainnet price feeds. Current implementation assumes devnet feed is hardcoded.

**Functions to Update** (in `packages/programs/programs/slop-machine/src/utils/oracle.rs`):
1. `get_sol_price_usd(pyth_account: &AccountInfo)` - Already accepts account parameter ✅
2. `usd_to_lamports(usd_amount: f64, pyth_account: &AccountInfo, clock: &Clock)` - Already parameterized ✅
3. `lamports_to_usd(lamports: u64, pyth_account: &AccountInfo, clock: &Clock)` - Already parameterized ✅

**Configuration Update Required:**

Update instruction contexts to pass the appropriate Pyth feed account based on deployment cluster:

```rust
// In instruction context structs (e.g., CreateOpportunity, SubmitBidWithStake)
pub struct InstructionContext<'info> {
    // ... other accounts ...

    /// CHECK: Pyth SOL/USD price feed account
    /// Devnet: J83w4HKfqxwcq3BEMMkPFSppX3gqekLyLJBexebFVkix
    /// Mainnet: H6ARHf6YXhGYeQfUzQNGk6rDNnLBQKrenN712K4AQJEG
    pub pyth_price_feed: AccountInfo<'info>,
}
```

**Client-Side Configuration:**

Update test files and client code to use correct feed address:

```typescript
// Devnet (current)
const PYTH_DEVNET_SOL_USD = new PublicKey("J83w4HKfqxwcq3BEMMkPFSppX3gqekLyLJBexebFVkix");

// Mainnet (add for Story 1.9)
const PYTH_MAINNET_SOL_USD = new PublicKey("H6ARHf6YXhGYeQfUzQNGk6rDNnLBQKrenN712K4AQJEG");

// Use appropriate feed based on cluster
const pythFeed = provider.cluster === "mainnet-beta" ? PYTH_MAINNET_SOL_USD : PYTH_DEVNET_SOL_USD;
```

**No Rust Code Changes Required:** The oracle helper functions are already parameterized correctly. Only client-side code and tests need to pass the mainnet Pyth account address instead of devnet address.

**Solana RPC Configuration** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#solana-rpc-api-helius]:

Mainnet RPC endpoints:
- Primary: `https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API_KEY>` (Helius)
- Configured via `HELIUS_RPC_URL` environment variable
- Rate limits: Growth tier 1000 requests/second (sufficient for MVP)

### File Locations and Structure

Based on the project source tree [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:

docs/architecture/external-apis.md              # MODIFIED: Document mainnet Pyth feed
```

### Anchor Configuration

Current `Anchor.toml` configuration:

```toml
[programs.devnet]
slop_machine = "4hPgUuR7S8pyX7WxgaKTunaPCjMQLhEmBgQEyTrTvDNt"

[programs.mainnet]
slop_machine = "DoxwpkBr2cNu2NYxWEZjopYtZwHzQPJuzZFasinMAXKm"  # Placeholder, will be updated

[provider.mainnet]
cluster = "${HELIUS_RPC_URL}"
wallet = "~/.config/solana/id.json"
```

**Actions Required:**
1. Deploy to mainnet and capture deployed program ID
2. Update `[programs.mainnet]` section with actual deployed ID
3. Update `declare_id!` in `lib.rs` with same ID
4. Rebuild to verify ID matches

### Deployment Checklist

**Pre-Deployment Verification** [Source: Epic 1 Story 1.9 AC #1]:

1. **All devnet tests passing**:
   - ✅ 71 unit tests passing (from Stories 1.1-1.7)
   - ✅ 7 integration tests passing (from Story 1.8b)
   - ✅ QA gate PASS with quality score 90/100

2. **Security audit considerations**:
   - Custom escrow program scheduled for audit (Week 5-7, not blocking mainnet v1.0)
   - Gradual rollout with escrow limits: $100 → $500 → $1K → unlimited
   - Bug bounty program on Immunefi (10% of TVL)
   - Real-time monitoring dashboard

3. **Upgrade authority configuration**:
   - Deployer wallet: `~/.config/solana/id.json`
   - Upgrade authority: Same wallet (can be transferred later)
   - Authority can upgrade program via `anchor upgrade`

4. **Emergency pause mechanism**:
   - ⚠️ Not implemented in v1.0 (document for future version)
   - Alternative: Upgrade program with paused version if critical bug found
   - Recovery Time Objective: <30 minutes

### Smoke Test Design

**Test Strategy** [Source: Epic 1 Story 1.9 AC #5]:

Smoke tests validate core functionality with minimal SOL:
1. Create test project with 0.1 SOL budget
2. Create test opportunity for $5 story (converted via Pyth mainnet)
3. Register test node (tier 0)
4. Submit bid with stake (0.025 SOL bid + 0.125 SOL stake @ 5x multiplier)
5. Accept bid and verify escrow lock
6. Simulate validation pass → verify payment + stake return

**Test Wallet Requirements**:
- ~0.5 SOL total for all smoke tests
- Breakdown:
  - 0.1 SOL for project budget
  - 0.15 SOL for bid + stake
  - 0.05 SOL for transaction fees
  - 0.15 SOL for rent-exempt accounts

**Transaction Verification**:
- All transactions logged with signatures
- Verified on Solana Explorer (solscan.io or solana.fm)
- Results documented in `mainnet-smoke-test-results.md`

### Testing Requirements

**Test Framework**: Anchor integration tests (TypeScript)
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]

**Test File Location**:
- Smoke tests: `packages/programs/tests/mainnet-smoke-test.spec.ts`
- Test results: `packages/programs/tests/mainnet-smoke-test-results.md`

**Test Execution**:
```bash
# Fund test wallet (manual step)
solana airdrop 1 <test-wallet-pubkey> --url mainnet-beta  # Note: Mainnet faucet doesn't exist, must fund manually

# Run smoke tests on mainnet
anchor test --provider.cluster mainnet --skip-build tests/mainnet-smoke-test.spec.ts

# Expected output: All tests pass with transaction signatures
```

**Test Standards** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:
- Use `expect()` assertions (chai library)
- Include transaction signatures in test results
- Verify account balances before/after each operation
- Log all RPC calls for debugging
- Test execution time should be <10 minutes (mainnet RPC latency)

### Coding Standards Compliance

**Deployment Commands** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]:
- All blockchain transactions MUST be simulated before submission (Anchor does this automatically)
- Solana transactions MUST include priority fees (configure in `Anchor.toml` or programmatically)

**Configuration Updates**:
```toml
# Anchor.toml - Priority fees for mainnet
[provider.mainnet]
cluster = "${HELIUS_RPC_URL}"
wallet = "~/.config/solana/id.json"
# Note: Priority fees configured in transaction builders, not Anchor.toml
```

### Integration with Future Stories

**Epic 2: Story Workflow**
- Will use mainnet program for production workflows
- AI agents will interact with mainnet accounts
- Work submissions will be validated on mainnet
- Token launches will use mainnet pump.fun integration

**Monitoring and Operations**
- Helius webhooks for real-time event monitoring
- Alert system for transaction failures
- Daily transaction count reporting
- Escrow balance monitoring

### Dependencies and Imports

Smoke test implementation requires:
```typescript
import * as anchor from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Program } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { SlopMachine } from "../target/types/slop_machine";
import { expect } from "chai";
import { PublicKey, Keypair, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL } from "@solana/web3.js";

// Mainnet Pyth SOL/USD feed
const PYTH_MAINNET_SOL_USD = new PublicKey("H6ARHf6YXhGYeQfUzQNGk6rDNnLBQKrenN712K4AQJEG");
```

### Security Considerations

**Deployment Security** [Source: architecture/security.md]:

1. **Upgrade Authority (CRITICAL)**:
   - Initial authority: Deployer wallet
   - Can be transferred to multisig (recommended for production)
   - Upgrade process requires full rebuild + redeployment

2. **Mainnet Wallet Security**:
   - Use hardware wallet (Ledger) for deployer wallet
   - Never expose private key in logs or environment variables
   - Rotate wallet if compromised

3. **Program Verification**:
   - Submit program for verification on Solana Explorer
   - Upload IDL for transparency
   - Document source code location (GitHub)

4. **Gradual Rollout**:
   - Start with escrow limits ($100 max)
   - Monitor for 7 days before increasing limits
   - Increase to $500 → $1K → unlimited over 4 weeks

### Monitoring Configuration

**Helius Webhooks** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#solana-rpc-api-helius]:

Configure webhooks for program events:
- `OpportunityCreated` - New story posted
- `BidSubmitted` - Node bids on opportunity
- `BidAccepted` - Bid accepted, escrow locked
- `PaymentReleased` - Work validated, payment distributed
- `StakeSlashed` - Validation failed, stake slashed

**Alert Thresholds**:
- Transaction failure rate >10% (trigger rollback)
- Escrow account balance <expected (potential exploit)
- No transactions for 24 hours (potential RPC issue)

**Monitoring Dashboard**:
- Real-time transaction count
- Escrow TVL (Total Value Locked)
- Average transaction success rate
- Recent transaction log

### Known Limitations (v1.0)

Document in deployment announcement:
- No emergency pause mechanism (v2 feature)
- Upgrade authority is single wallet (multisig in v2)
- Escrow limits during gradual rollout ($100 → $500 → $1K → unlimited)
- Manual monitoring required (automated monitoring in v2)

### Testing

**Test File Location**: `packages/programs/tests/mainnet-smoke-test.spec.ts`

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Project creation with real SOL
- ✅ Opportunity creation with Pyth mainnet oracle
- ✅ Node registration
- ✅ Bid submission with stake
- ✅ Bid acceptance and escrow lock
- ✅ Payment release simulation

**Test Execution**:
```bash
# Step 1: Build program
anchor build

# Step 2: Deploy to mainnet (requires funded wallet)
anchor deploy --provider.cluster mainnet

# Step 3: Update configuration with deployed program ID
# (manual edit of Anchor.toml and lib.rs)

# Step 4: Run smoke tests
anchor test --provider.cluster mainnet --skip-build tests/mainnet-smoke-test.spec.ts

# Step 5: Document results
# Copy test output to packages/programs/tests/mainnet-smoke-test-results.md
```
