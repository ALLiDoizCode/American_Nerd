# Solana Escrow Programs Research Report
## Battle-Tested Options for AI-Powered Marketplace

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Purpose:** Identify production-ready, audited Solana escrow solutions for marketplace with arbiter approval and payment splitting

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive research into battle-tested Solana escrow programs, **Squads Protocol V4** emerges as the strongest candidate for the American Nerd Marketplace use case. While not a traditional escrow program, it provides formally verified, extensively audited infrastructure for multi-party payments, approval workflows, and payment splitting that can be adapted for marketplace escrow functionality.

**Key Finding:** There is no widely available, production-ready, standalone audited escrow program on Solana that supports all required features out-of-the-box (arbiter approval, payment splitting, refunds). The best approach is either:
1. Build a custom escrow program and get it audited (Cost: $15,000-$50,000)
2. Integrate Squads Protocol V4 for multisig-based escrow (Most secure, battle-tested)
3. Fork and adapt Anchor escrow examples with professional audit

- **Eclipse Mainnet:** `eSQDSMLf3qxwHVHeTr9amVAGmZbRLY2rFdSURandt6f`

#### Key Features for Marketplace Use Case
1. **Multi-party Payments:** Native support for splitting payments among multiple recipients
2. **Approval Workflows:** Configurable signature thresholds for transaction approval (arbiter role)
3. **Roles & Permissions:** Granular roles (Proposer, Approver, Executor) - perfect for arbiter setup
4. **Time Locks:** Optional delays before transaction execution
5. **Spending Limits:** Sub-accounts with pre-approved spending limits
6. **Escrow Functionality:** API supports escrow for marketplaces and commerce platforms
7. **Sub-accounts:** Segregate funds for different purposes/projects

#### How It Maps to Marketplace Requirements

| Requirement | Squads V4 Implementation |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Client funds escrow | Create multisig with client as initiator, platform as approver |
| Hold SOL | Native SOL support via multisig vault |
| Arbiter approval | Use multisig approval threshold (e.g., 2-of-3: client, platform, validator) |
| 85-95% to worker, 5-15% to platform | Multi-party payment instruction with predefined splits |
| Refunds if rejected | Proposal to return funds to client, approved by arbiter |

#### Integration Approach
```rust
// Conceptual integration via CPI
use squads_multisig::CpiContext;

// 1. Create escrow multisig when client accepts bid
// 2. Client deposits SOL to multisig vault
// 3. On work completion, AI node proposes payment transaction
// 4. Arbiter approves if work is satisfactory
// 5. Execute multi-party payment: 90% to worker, 10% to platform
// 6. If rejected, arbiter approves refund proposal
```

#### CPI Integration
- **Rust Crate:** `squads-multisig` (v2.1.0+)
- **TypeScript SDK:** `@sqds/multisig`
- **Documentation:** https://docs.squads.so
- **Examples:** https://github.com/Squads-Protocol/v4-examples (includes `rust_anchor_cpi` examples)

#### Limitations & Workarounds
- **Not a traditional escrow:** Requires adaptation of multisig patterns for escrow use case
- **Higher complexity:** CPI integration with multisig is more complex than simple escrow
- **Gas costs:** Multiple transactions required (create proposal, approve, execute)

**Workaround:** Abstract complexity with a custom wrapper program that uses Squads as the underlying security layer via CPI

#### Maintenance Status
- **Active Development:** 519+ commits, latest in 2024
- **Community Support:** Large ecosystem, extensive documentation
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/Squads-Protocol/v4

#### Cost Estimate
- **Integration Effort:** 2-4 weeks for experienced Solana developers
- **Cost:** Medium complexity (~$10,000-$20,000 for custom wrapper + integration)
- **Benefit:** No audit cost (leveraging battle-tested infrastructure)

## Security Best Practices for Solana Escrow

Based on research, here are critical security considerations for any escrow implementation:

### 1. Account Validation
- Use properly typed Anchor accounts (`Account<'info, T>`) not raw `AccountInfo`
- Verify all account ownerships with `#[account]` constraints
- Check signer requirements on all authority accounts

### 2. PDA Security
- Store bump seeds on-chain to prevent alternative derivations
- Use canonical bumps only
- Validate PDA derivations in every instruction

### 3. Token Operations
- Use `transfer_checked` for all token transfers (validates decimals and mint)
- Essential for Token-2022 compatibility
- Prevents spoofed token attacks

### 4. Authority Management
- PDAs should have sole signing authority over vault accounts
- Never allow users to retain vault ownership
- Close authority must be the program, not users

### 5. State Machine Validation
- Clearly define escrow states (Created, Funded, Completed, Refunded, Cancelled)
- Validate state transitions in each instruction
- Use Anchor's `#[account]` constraints for state checks

### 6. Arithmetic Safety
- Use checked arithmetic for all calculations
- Particularly important for payment splits and fee calculations
- Prevent overflow/underflow vulnerabilities

### 7. Reentrancy Protection
- Solana's execution model provides natural reentrancy protection
- Still validate account ownership on every CPI
- Be cautious with CPIs to unknown programs

### 8. Testing
- Unit tests for all instructions
- Integration tests for full workflows
- Fuzzing for edge cases
- Test on devnet extensively before mainnet

## Appendix: Technical Implementation Sketch

### Escrow Wrapper Program (Pseudocode)

```rust
// programs/marketplace-escrow/src/lib.rs

use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use squads_multisig::cpi::{accounts::*, instructions::*};

declare_id!("Your_Program_ID_Here");

#[program]
pub mod marketplace_escrow {
    use super::*;

    /// Initialize escrow when client accepts bid
    /// Creates a Squads multisig: client + arbiter + platform
    pub fn initialize_escrow(
        ctx: Context<InitializeEscrow>,
        amount: u64,
        worker_pubkey: Pubkey,
        worker_share_bps: u16, // e.g., 9000 = 90%
    ) -> Result<()> {
        // Create 2-of-3 multisig via CPI to Squads
        // Members: client, arbiter, platform
        // Threshold: 2 (arbiter + one other)

        let escrow = &mut ctx.accounts.escrow;
        escrow.client = ctx.accounts.client.key();
        escrow.worker = worker_pubkey;
        escrow.amount = amount;
        escrow.worker_share_bps = worker_share_bps;

        );

        let escrow = &ctx.accounts.escrow;
        let worker_amount = (escrow.amount * escrow.worker_share_bps as u64) / 10000;
        let platform_amount = escrow.amount - worker_amount;

        // Create proposal for multi-party payment via Squads CPI
        // Destination 1: worker (90%)

        // ... implementation ...

        ctx.accounts.escrow.status = EscrowStatus::Completed;
        Ok(())
    }

    /// Arbiter rejects work and issues refund
    pub fn reject_and_refund(ctx: Context<RejectRefund>) -> Result<()> {
        require!(
            ctx.accounts.arbiter.is_signer,
            ErrorCode::Unauthorized
        );

        // Create proposal to refund client via Squads CPI
        // ... implementation ...

        ctx.accounts.escrow.status = EscrowStatus::Refunded;
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[account]
pub struct Escrow {
    pub client: Pubkey,
    pub worker: Pubkey,
    pub arbiter: Pubkey,
    pub multisig: Pubkey, // Squads multisig address
    pub amount: u64,
    pub worker_share_bps: u16,
    pub status: EscrowStatus,
    pub bump: u8,
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum EscrowStatus {
    Created,
    Funded,
    Completed,
    Refunded,
    Cancelled,
}

#[error_code]
pub enum ErrorCode {
    #[msg("Unauthorized: Only arbiter can perform this action")]
    Unauthorized,
    #[msg("Invalid escrow status for this operation")]
    InvalidStatus,
}
```

This pseudocode demonstrates the high-level architecture. Actual implementation requires:
- Proper CPI context setup for Squads
- PDA derivation and signing
- Error handling
- Account validation
- Comprehensive testing
