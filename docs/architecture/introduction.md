# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for **Slop Machine**, including blockchain infrastructure, AI agent systems, storage layers, and client interfaces. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A** - This is a greenfield project built from scratch. All tooling, configuration, and infrastructure will be designed specifically for the blockchain-native, AI-agent-driven marketplace requirements.
