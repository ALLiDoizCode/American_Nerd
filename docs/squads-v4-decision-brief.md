# Squads Protocol V4 Integration Decision Brief

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Decision:** 🚫 **DO NOT PROCEED** with Squads V4 integration
**Recommendation:** Build custom escrow program instead
**Confidence:** 95%

---

## TL;DR

**Squads V4 is a multisig wallet for human voting, not an automated escrow system.**

Using it for our marketplace would be like using a democracy voting system to automate a vending machine — technically possible, but fundamentally the wrong tool.

---

## The Core Problem

### What Squads V4 Is Built For
```
Multiple humans → vote on proposals → reach consensus → execute transaction
```
**Use case:** DAO treasuries, company wallets, shared funds

### What We Need
```
Validator approves work → funds instantly release to 3 recipients
```
**Use case:** Automated escrow for AI agent payments

**These are fundamentally different architectures.**

---

## Why Squads V4 Doesn't Fit (Quick Facts)

| Metric | Squads V4 | Custom Escrow | Difference |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Transactions per escrow lifecycle | 5 | 2 | **2.5x worse** |
| Accounts per escrow | 3 | 1 | **3x more complex** |
| Rent cost per escrow | 0.006 SOL | 0.001 SOL | **6x more expensive** |
| Compute units | 172,000 CU | 65,000 CU | **2.6x less efficient** |
| Development time | 3-4 weeks | 2-3 weeks | **1 week slower** |
| Lines of code | 500+ | ~200 | **2.5x more complex** |

**Summary:** Squads V4 is slower, more expensive, more complex, and architecturally misaligned.

## The Squads V4 Workflow (What We'd Have to Do)

For **EVERY** escrow transaction:

1. **Create multisig** (one-time setup)
   - Configure validator as a "member" with voting rights
   - Set threshold to 1
   - Pay rent for Multisig account (~0.00174 SOL)

2. **Create vault transaction** (when client deposits)
   - Serialize 3 `SystemProgram::transfer` instructions (dev, QA, platform)
   - Create VaultTransaction account (~0.00356 SOL rent)
   - Recipient wallets and amounts are LOCKED at this point

3. **Create proposal** (to enable voting)
   - Create Proposal account (~0.00070 SOL rent)
   - Mark as Active

4. **Validator "approves"** (when work is validated)
   - Validator calls `proposal_approve` (simulating a "vote")
   - Wait for transaction confirmation

5. **Execute vault transaction** (finally release funds)
   - Call `vault_transaction_execute`
   - Squads executes the 3 transfers via CPI
   - Funds distributed

**For refunds:** Repeat steps 2-5 with a different vault transaction (single recipient: client)

**Total: 5 transactions** (4 after initial multisig setup) **per escrow.**

---

## Custom Escrow Workflow (What We Should Do)

1. **Client creates and funds escrow**
   - Single transaction
   - Funds held in escrow PDA
   - State: `Funded`

2. **Validator approves OR rejects**
   - **If approved:** Instant 3-way split (85% dev, 10% QA, 5% platform)
   - **If rejected:** Instant full refund to client
   - Single transaction

**Total: 2 transactions per escrow.**

## Cost Analysis Example

**Scenario:** 1,000 escrows processed per month

### Squads V4 Costs
- **Rent:** 0.006 SOL × 1,000 = **6 SOL/month** (~$1,200 @ $200/SOL)
- **Compute units:** 172,000 × 1,000 = **172M CU/month**
- **Transactions:** 4 × 1,000 = **4,000 tx/month** (gas fees + priority fees)

### Custom Escrow Costs
- **Rent:** 0.001 SOL × 1,000 = **1 SOL/month** (~$200)
- **Compute units:** 65,000 × 1,000 = **65M CU/month**
- **Transactions:** 2 × 1,000 = **2,000 tx/month**

### Monthly Savings
- **Rent:** 5 SOL saved (~$1,000/month)
- **Compute:** 107M CU saved (~40% reduction in gas costs)
- **Transactions:** 2,000 fewer transactions (~50% reduction)

**Annual operational savings: ~$12,000 in rent alone**

## Development Effort Comparison

### Squads V4 Integration
**Week 1:** CPI setup, multisig initialization logic
**Week 2:** Vault transaction + proposal flow, multi-recipient splits
**Week 3:** Testing (unit + integration), debugging CPI errors
**Week 4:** Edge cases, error handling, documentation

**Total: 15-19 developer days (~3-4 weeks)**

**Complexity risks:**
- Managing 3 Squads accounts per escrow
- CPI call chains (2 CPIs per approval)
- Refund requires creating new vault transactions
- Hard to reason about state across multiple accounts

### Custom Escrow
**Week 1:** Core logic (3 instructions: create/fund, approve/distribute, reject/refund)
**Week 2:** Testing (unit + integration), edge cases
**Week 3:** Audit prep (documentation, security analysis)
**Week 4:** Professional audit + address findings

**Total: 10-14 developer days (~2-3 weeks) + external audit time**

**Benefits:**
- Single account, clear state machine
- Direct logic, no CPI overhead
- Easy to extend (partial releases, milestones, etc.)
- Simple debugging and monitoring

**Net savings: 5-6 developer days**

## Security Considerations

### Squads V4 Security
✅ **Strengths:**
- 4 professional audits (OtterSec, Neodyme, Certora, Trail of Bits)
- Formal verification (Certora)
- $15B+ TVL secured
- Battle-tested in production

⚠️ **Integration Risks:**
- **Complexity = attack surface:** Our logic + Squads logic = compounded risk
- **CPI risks:** Reentrancy, account confusion across 3 accounts
- **More validation needed:** 3 accounts to verify per transaction

### Custom Escrow Security
✅ **Strengths:**
- **Simple = auditable:** ~200 lines of core logic
- **Single account:** Clear ownership, minimal confusion
- **Direct control:** No external program dependencies

⚠️ **Requirements:**
- **Must have professional audit** (~$15-30K)
- **We own maintenance** (bugs, upgrades)

**Verdict:** With a professional audit, custom escrow is likely **MORE secure** due to simplicity and reduced attack surface.

## Why This Matters for AI Automation

Our marketplace is **built for AI agents**, not humans:

1. **Speed:** AI completes work in minutes/hours, not days
   - **Squads V4:** 5-transaction approval flow adds latency
   - **Custom:** Instant release on approval

2. **Predictability:** AI workflows need deterministic execution
   - **Squads V4:** Multisig voting model adds uncertainty
   - **Custom:** Single authority decision = predictable

3. **Cost efficiency:** High-volume AI transactions need low overhead
   - **Squads V4:** 6x rent, 2.6x compute costs
   - **Custom:** Optimized for automated, high-frequency operations

4. **Developer experience:** Building AI integrations requires simple APIs
   - **Squads V4:** Managing proposals, votes, multisig state
   - **Custom:** Simple escrow state machine

**Bottom line:** Squads V4 was designed for slow, human-governed treasuries. We're building a fast, automated marketplace.

## The "But What About..." Responses

### "But Squads is battle-tested with $15B TVL!"
True, but that's for multisig wallets, not escrow. Their security doesn't transfer to our use case—we'd be using it in an unintended way, which could introduce NEW vulnerabilities.

Custom escrow with a professional audit (same firms that audit Squads) gives us security tailored to our actual needs.

### "But building custom means we own the bugs!"
Yes, but we also own the features, performance, and user experience. A simple 200-line escrow program is easier to maintain than 500+ lines of Squads integration glue code.

**Trade-off:** One-time $20K audit vs. ongoing operational costs (6x rent, 2.6x compute) that compound forever.

### "But can't we just set threshold=1 and bypass the voting?"
Yes, but then we're still paying for:
- 3 accounts instead of 1 (rent overhead)
- 2 CPI calls instead of direct logic (compute overhead)
- 5 transactions instead of 2 (gas + UX overhead)
- Multisig features we don't need (time locks, member management, etc.)

We'd be renting a 10-bedroom mansion to use as a single-person studio apartment.

### "But what if we need multisig later?"
Then we add it to our custom escrow! Feature flexibility is easier with code we control.

Example: Adding a 2-of-3 validator approval for large amounts (>10 SOL) would take ~50 lines of code in our escrow. With Squads, we'd already have multisig, but we'd lose the simplicity that makes our system fast and cheap for 99% of transactions.

## Recommendation Summary

### DO NOT use Squads V4 because:
1. ❌ Architectural mismatch (multisig voting vs. single arbiter escrow)
2. ❌ 2.5x more transactions per escrow
3. ❌ 6x more expensive in rent
4. ❌ 2.6x more compute units
5. ❌ Slower UX (multi-transaction approval flow)
6. ❌ More complex (3 accounts vs. 1)
7. ❌ Harder to customize for AI workflows
8. ❌ Higher ongoing operational costs

### DO build custom escrow because:
1. ✅ Perfect architectural fit (single validator authority)
2. ✅ 2 transactions per escrow (simple workflow)
3. ✅ 6x cheaper in rent
4. ✅ 2.6x less compute (lower gas costs)
5. ✅ Instant approval/release UX
6. ✅ Simple (1 account, clear state machine)
7. ✅ Easy to extend (milestones, partial releases, etc.)
8. ✅ Lower long-term costs

### Investment Required
- **Development:** 2-3 weeks (~10-14 developer days)
- **Audit:** $15-30K (one-time)
- **Total cost:** ~$25K (development + audit)

### Break-Even Analysis
- **Monthly savings:** ~$1,000 in rent + gas efficiency
- **Break-even:** ~2 years at 1,000 escrows/month
- **But:** Better UX, faster execution, and simpler maintenance are immediate benefits
