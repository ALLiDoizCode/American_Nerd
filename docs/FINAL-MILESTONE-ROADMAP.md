# American Nerd Marketplace: Final Milestone Roadmap

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** Ready for PRD Update

---

## Vision

**Blockchain-native AI marketplace where AI agents do the work, humans validate quality, and BMAD methodology ensures perfect context handoff - all coordinated via Solana smart contracts with permanent storage on Arweave.**

---

## Core Innovations

1. **AI Agents as Primary Workers** - AI personas (not humans) implement work
2. **BMAD as Context Protocol** - Structured documents enable AI-to-AI collaboration
3. **Blockchain Coordination** - Solana smart contracts manage all state, bidding, escrow
4. **Arweave as Memory** - Permanent, immutable document storage for validation
5. **Dual Storage Strategy** - GitHub (mutable working copy) + Arweave (immutable proof)
6. **Humans as Validators** - Quality gates, not creators
7. **Distributed Compute Network** - Anyone can run AI nodes and monetize compute

---

## Economic Model

### Revenue Streams

**Platform Fees (5% of every transaction):**
- Architecture: $5 per (if avg $100)
- Story: $5 per (if avg $100)
- Target: 50 projects/month × 10 stories × $5 = $2,500/month

**Node Operator Revenue:**
- Architect node: $95 per architecture (after 5% platform fee)
- Developer node: $85 per story (after 5% platform + 10% QA)
- QA validator: $10 per story validation

**Example Node Economics:**
- Developer node: 20 stories/month = ~$1,700/month
- Costs: Claude API $100, hosting $20 = **$1,580 profit/month**

### Cost Structure

**Per Project:**
- Arweave storage: ~$0.01 (one-time, permanent)
- Solana transactions: ~$0.08 (network fees)
- Claude API: ~$10-20 (node operator cost)
- Total platform cost: ~$0.09 per project

**Target Unit Economics:**
- Platform revenue: $250 per project (avg 50 stories × $5)
- Platform costs: $0.09 + $500/month ops / 50 projects = ~$10 per project
- **Platform margin: $240 per project (96%)**

## Storage Architecture

### What Lives Where

**Arweave (Immutable Snapshots):**
- ✅ prd.md content (~10KB, $0.001)
- ✅ architecture.md content (~50KB, $0.005)
- ✅ story.md content (~2KB each, $0.0002)
- ✅ Screenshots (frontend proof, ~100KB, $0.01)
- **Purpose:** Validation proof, AI context source, payment reference

**Solana (State & Coordination):**
- ✅ Arweave TX IDs (43 bytes each)
- ✅ Project/Opportunity/Bid metadata
- ✅ Escrow state & payment logic
- ✅ Reputation scores
- **Purpose:** Fast state transitions, payments, discovery

**GitHub (Mutable Working Copy):**
- ✅ All documents (PRD, architecture, etc.)
- ✅ Code files
- ✅ Pull Requests
- ✅ Commit history
- **Purpose:** Development workflow, collaboration, version control

**Dual Strategy:** Documents in both GitHub (editable) + Arweave (immutable proof)

---

## Key Design Decisions

### ✅ **Confirmed Decisions**

1. **Blockchain-Native** - No backend server, all state on Solana
2. **SOL as Native Currency** - Everything priced in SOL with USD oracle
3. **Arweave for Documents** - Permanent, immutable proof ($0.01 per project)
4. **Auto-Sharding by Nodes** - Clients don't need to shard, nodes handle it
5. **BMAD Methodology** - Standardized templates enforce complete context
6. **Dual Storage** - GitHub (working) + Arweave (proof)
7. **Agent-to-Agent** - AI agents can create projects via local MCP
8. **Social Personas** - Twitter/Discord for trust and discovery
9. **Deep Links for Payments** - Phantom/Solflare/Backpack wallet integration

### 🤔 **Deferred Decisions** (Post-MVP)

1. **UI/Frontend Workflow** - Needs mockup validation flow (client provides mockups or constant review during dev)
2. **UX Agent** - Complex visual validation, requires Playwright setup by nodes, needs design
3. **PM Agent (Story Decomposition)** - Automatic story breakdown from PRD, deferred
4. **Project Templates** - Pre-built PRDs for common project types, nice to have
5. **Multi-Currency** - USDC/USDT support, deferred
6. **Fiat Payments** - Stripe integration, deferred
7. **Multi-Chain** - Polygon/Base support, deferred

### ✅ **Included in MVP**

1. **Analyst Agent (analyst.txt)** - Brainstorming + brief creation in Milestone 3 MCP
2. **PM Agent (pm.txt)** - PRD generation in Milestone 3 MCP
3. **Auto-Sharding** - Nodes handle large docs automatically (Milestone 1)
4. **SOL/USD Oracle** - Stable pricing via Pyth (Milestone 0)

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **AI quality inconsistent** | BMAD templates + human validation gates |
| **Not enough AI nodes** | Platform runs initial nodes, agent self-funding creates activity |
| **Not enough clients** | Self-fund test projects, MCP makes onboarding frictionless |
| **Smart contract bugs** | Comprehensive testing, audit, deploy to devnet first, bug bounty |
| **Solana network issues** | Use priority fees, implement retry logic, plan multi-chain |
| **Arweave costs spike** | Still <$0.01 per project, acceptable |
| **Payment disputes** | Arweave provides immutable proof, validator decision is final |
| **SOL volatility** | Pyth oracle provides stable USD equivalent pricing |
