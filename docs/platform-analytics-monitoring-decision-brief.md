# Platform Analytics & Monitoring - Executive Decision Brief

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Project:** Slop Machine (Epic 11 - Platform Analytics)
**Research Duration:** 5 Business Days
**Recommendation:** âœ… **GO** - Hybrid Approach (Dune + Helius + Grafana Cloud)

---

## Executive Summary

### Recommended Solution

**Primary Analytics Platform:** Dune Analytics Plus ($399/month)
**Real-time Data:** Helius Professional ($999/month)
**Infrastructure Monitoring:** Grafana Cloud Free Tier ($0)
**Total 12-Month TCO:** **$86,428**

### Rationale

1. **Fastest Time-to-Market** - 3-4 weeks to production vs. 8 weeks self-hosted
2. **Balanced Capabilities** - SQL dashboards (Dune) + real-time webhooks (Helius) + infrastructure metrics (Grafana)
3. **Reasonable Cost** - $86K/year vs. $147K self-hosted or $102K Flipside
4. **Low Risk** - Proven platforms, managed services, minimal DevOps burden
5. **Future Flexibility** - Data export APIs enable migration to self-hosted in Year 2

## Key Findings

### Top 3 Platform Options

| Rank | Platform | Strengths | Weaknesses | 12-Month TCO |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Dune + Helius + Grafana** (Hybrid) | Fast setup, flexible architecture, real-time + historical | Integration complexity, partial vendor lock-in | **$86,428** |
| 2 | **Dune + Grafana** (Managed) | Fastest (2 weeks), proven, community support | Limited customization, vendor lock-in | $64,428 |
| 3 | **Self-Hosted** (Geyser + TimescaleDB) | Maximum control, no lock-in, long-term savings | 8 weeks setup, ongoing maintenance, $80K upfront | $147,440 |

### Performance Expectations

- **Data Freshness:** Real-time (<1 min) for critical metrics via Helius webhooks, 5-15 min for Dune dashboards
- **Query Response Time:** <1s for simple queries, <5s for complex aggregations
- **Dashboard Load Time:** <2s for public dashboards (with CDN caching)
- **Scalability:** Supports 500 nodes, 1K projects, 50K stories (Month 24 projections)

## Critical Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Vendor API downtime** | Medium | High | Multi-vendor strategy (Dune + Helius), aggressive caching (Redis), fallback to public RPC |
| **Cost overruns** | Medium | Medium | Usage alerts at 95% budget, spending caps on RPC providers, monthly cost reviews |
| **Data accuracy issues** | Low | High | Validation queries (compare on-chain vs indexed), automated daily reconciliation tests |
| **Infinite tier calculation errors** | Low | Critical | Unit tests for mathematical formulas (sqrt, exp, floor), compare smart contract vs analytics results |
| **RPC rate limit hits** | Medium | Medium | Multiple RPC providers (Helius + Triton + public fallback), circuit breaker pattern |
