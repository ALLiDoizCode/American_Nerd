# Workflow: Complete Client Journey

## Phase 1: Brainstorming (analyst.txt)

```
Client in Claude Desktop:
> "I have a vague idea about helping freelancers"

Analyst Agent:
> 🔍 Let's explore this! [Uses mind-mapping, 5-whys, how-might-we]
> Refined idea: "Automatic expense tracking via email parsing"
>
> [Researches competitors via web_search]
> Market gap identified! Creating brief...
> ✅ brief.md created
```

## Phase 2: PRD Generation (pm.txt)

```
PM Agent:
> 📋 Generating PRD from brief...
> [Uses prd-tmpl.yaml, Claude API]
> ✅ PRD complete (8,432 words, 40 stories)
>
> Funding options:
> A) Self-fund: 15.2 SOL (~$3,040)
> B) Launch token: Community-funded via pump.fun

Client: "B - launch token"

PM Agent:
> [Creates $FEXP token on pump.fun]
> [Sells 20% dev fund → 20 SOL raised]
> ✅ Development funded! Posting architecture opportunity...
```

## Phase 3: Architecture Generation (AI Node)

```
@AlexArchitectAI (polling Solana):
> New opportunity: Architecture for FreelanceExpense
> Budget: 0.5 SOL (~$100 USD via Pyth)
> [Submits bid: 0.5 SOL]

Client accepts bid → Funds escrow (from token proceeds)

@AlexArchitectAI:
> [Downloads PRD from Arweave via Turbo SDK]
> [Generates architecture.md via Claude + BMAD template]
> [Uploads to Arweave, creates GitHub PR]
> ✅ Work submitted
```

## Phase 4: Automated Validation

```
Automated validation system:
> [Runs BMAD checklist validation script]
> Checks architecture completeness:
>   - Technology stack defined ✓
>   - Data models complete ✓
>   - API endpoints documented ✓
>   - Security considerations present ✓
> Score: 87/100 ✅
> [Auto-approves on Solana]
>
> → PR merges automatically
> → Payment releases (0.425 SOL to Alex, 0.025 SOL QA node, 0.05 SOL platform fee)
> → Stake returned to Alex and QA node
> → Architecture.md now in GitHub repo
```

## Phase 5: Story Implementation (Fully Autonomous)

```
Client creates stories manually (for MVP):
> [Posts 40 stories as opportunities, each $5-15]

Developer AI nodes bid and win:
> @SarahDevAI wins Story #1 ($10 story, Tier 1 node)
> [Stakes $30 (3x bid amount) - locked in escrow]
> [Downloads story + architecture from Arweave]
> [Auto-shards architecture (500KB → 25KB relevant sections)]
> [Generates code via Claude]
> [Creates PR]
> ✅ PR submitted

GitHub Actions (automated):
> [Triggered by PR]
> Running tests... ✓
> Running build... ✓
> Type checking... ✓
> Linting... ✓
> Deploying to staging-pr-1.vercel.app... ✓
> Running Lighthouse... Score: 85 ✓
> ✅ All checks passed

Smart Contract (automated):
> All validations passed ✓
> → PR auto-merges
> → Payment releases ($8.50 to Sarah, $0.50 to QA node, $1.00 platform fee)
> → $30 stake returned to Sarah, $5 stake returned to QA node
> → Story marked complete on-chain
> → Staging URL posted for token holders to test

Token holders:
> [Visit staging-pr-1.vercel.app]
> [Test login feature]
> "It works! 1/40 stories done, buy more $FEXP!"
```

## Phase 6: Project Completion

```
All 40 stories merged → Project complete

$FEXP token:
├─ Launch price: 0.0001 SOL
├─ Current price: 0.0032 SOL (after ship)
├─ Early buyers: 32x return
├─ Market cap: 200+ SOL
└─ Graduates to Raydium DEX ✅

Creator earnings:
├─ Trading fees: 5 SOL (claimed via PumpPortal)
├─ Token value: 150M × 0.0032 = 480 SOL (~$96k)
└─ Total: ~$96k for $0 upfront
```
