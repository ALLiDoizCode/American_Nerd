# Epic 6: AI Developer Node & QA Workflow (Milestone 1)

**Duration:** 6 weeks (4 weeks dev implementation, 2 weeks QA workflow parallel)

**Epic Goal:** Implement the complete AI developer node workflow that downloads stories from Arweave, generates code with tests using the LLM abstraction layer, submits pull requests with fork-based GitHub integration, monitors validation failures, and iterates until passing or aborting to prevent stake slashing. Add QA review workflow where QA AI nodes review code before final CI/CD validation, creating a two-stage quality gate (human-like code review + automated testing). This epic enables fully autonomous code generation and review with economic incentives ensuring quality.

## Story 6.1: Auto-Sharding System

As a platform developer,
I want to integrate md-tree for automatic document sharding,
so that large PRDs and architecture documents can be split into manageable sections for LLM context windows.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. md-tree library integrated into node codebase
2. `shardDocument(document: string, maxTokens: number)` function implemented:
   - Takes markdown document as input
   - Splits by headings (##, ###, ####) intelligently
   - Each shard stays within maxTokens limit (default: 8000 tokens)
   - Preserves document structure and references
3. Shard metadata generated:
   - Shard ID (e.g., "prd_section_2_3")
   - Heading hierarchy (e.g., "Epic 1 > Story 1.2")
   - Token count per shard
   - Parent document reference
4. Shard storage:
   - Shards cached locally after first download
   - Cache key: `{arweave_tx_id}_{shard_id}`
   - Cache invalidation: 24 hours
5. Reassembly function for full document viewing:
   - `reassembleDocument(shards: Shard[])` merges shards back
6. Edge case handling:
   - Very large sections (>maxTokens): Split further by paragraph
   - Documents without proper headings: Split by character count
7. Performance: Sharding <2 seconds for 100KB document
8. Unit tests for sharding logic
9. Unit tests for token counting accuracy
10. Integration test: Shard large PRD, verify all sections present

## Story 6.2: Relevant Section Identification

As an AI developer node,
I want to use AI to identify which architecture sections are relevant to my assigned story,
so that I load only necessary context and stay within LLM token limits.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. `identifyRelevantSections(story: Story, architecture: Architecture)` function implemented:
   - Uses LLM (via Story 3.6 abstraction layer) to analyze relevance
   - Prompt: "Given this story: {story}, which architecture sections are needed?"
   - Returns list of relevant section IDs
2. Relevance scoring:
   - Each architecture section scored 0-100 for relevance
   - Threshold: Include sections with score â‰¥ 70
3. Smart section selection:
   - Always include: Tech stack, validation strategy, project metadata
   - Conditionally include: Component diagrams, data models (if story touches those areas)
   - Exclude: Unrelated sections (e.g., frontend spec for backend story)
4. Context budget management:
   - Calculate total tokens for story + selected sections
   - If exceeds budget (e.g., 80K tokens), remove lowest-scoring sections
5. Caching:
   - Cache relevance analysis results per story
   - Avoids re-analyzing same story multiple times
6. Fallback strategy:
   - If LLM fails, include all core sections (tech stack, validation, top-level architecture)
7. Unit tests for relevance scoring
8. Integration test: Analyze story, verify correct sections identified
9. Performance: Relevance analysis <10 seconds per story

---

## Story 6.3: Context Loading

As an AI developer node,
I want to load story, relevant architecture sections, and PRD context from Arweave,
so that I have complete project context for code generation.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. `loadStoryContext(storyId: string, projectId: string)` function implemented:
   - Downloads PRD from Arweave (Epic 2)
   - Downloads architecture from Arweave
   - Downloads story document from Arweave
   - Shards documents if needed (Story 6.1)
   - Identifies relevant architecture sections (Story 6.2)
2. Context object structure:
   ```typescript
   interface StoryContext {
     story: {
       id: string;
       title: string;
       userStory: string;
       acceptanceCriteria: string[];
     };
     architecture: {
       techStack: ArchitectureTechStack;
       validationStrategy: ValidationStrategy;
       relevantSections: ArchitectureSection[];
     };
     prd: {
       goals: string[];
       requirements: string[];
       epic: Epic;
     };
     tokenCount: number;
   }
   ```
3. Token budget enforcement:
   - Maximum context size: 80K tokens (leaves room for LLM response)
   - Priority order: Story > Tech stack > Validation > Architecture sections > PRD
   - Truncate lowest priority items if budget exceeded
4. Context validation:
   - All required fields present
   - No malformed markdown
   - References valid (e.g., story ID matches)
5. Error handling:
   - Document not found on Arweave
   - Parse errors (malformed YAML/markdown)
   - Timeout errors
6. Performance metrics:
   - Context loading time logged
   - Token count logged
7. Unit tests for context assembly
8. Integration test: Load context for devnet story, verify all sections present
9. Cache integration: Context cached for retry attempts

10. Integration test: Submit PR, monitor validation, verify status updated

---

## Story 6.7: Auto-Fix Iteration

As an AI developer node,
I want to automatically analyze validation failures and generate fixes,
so that I can iterate toward passing validation without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. `analyzeFailed Validation(results: ValidationResults)` function implemented:
   - Parses error messages from failed checks
   - Identifies fixable errors vs structural issues
   - Categorizes errors: Syntax, test failures, lint violations, type errors
2. `generateFix(error: ValidationError, originalCode: string, context: StoryContext, llmProvider: LLMProvider)` function:
   - Constructs prompt with error details
   - Includes original code and error message
   - Asks LLM to fix specific error
   - Returns fixed code
3. Fix prompt structure:
   ```
   The following code failed validation with this error:
   {errorMessage}

   Original code:
   {originalCode}

   Please fix the error while maintaining all functionality and tests.
   ```
4. Batch fixing:
   - If multiple errors in same file, fix all in one LLM call
   - If errors in different files, process in parallel
5. Fix validation:
   - Verify fix doesn't introduce new issues
   - Ensure tests still cover same cases
   - Check that acceptance criteria still met
6. Retry workflow:
   - Apply fixes to code
   - Commit fixes to same branch (new commit)
   - Push to fork
   - Validation automatically re-runs via GitHub Actions
7. Failure count tracking:
   - Track attempts (1st submission, 1st retry, 2nd retry)
   - Abort after 2 retries to avoid 3rd failure (stake slashing)
8. Non-fixable errors:
   - If error is structural (e.g., story requirements impossible), abort
   - Log reason for abort
   - Return stake (no slashing if impossible requirements)
9. Unit tests for error parsing
10. Integration test: Submit code with test failure â†’ auto-fix â†’ resubmit â†’ pass

## Story 6.8: Stake Awareness

As an AI developer node,
I want to track my failure count and abort after 2 failures,
so that I avoid the 3rd failure that triggers stake slashing.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. `trackFailureCount(storyId: string)` function implemented:
   - Queries Story account from Solana for failure_count
   - Stored locally in node state
   - Updated after each validation result
2. Failure count monitoring:
   - After 1st failure: Attempt auto-fix (Story 6.7)
   - After 2nd failure: Attempt auto-fix one more time
   - After 2nd retry fails: ABORT (do not submit 3rd attempt)
3. Abort logic:
   - If failure_count = 2 and retry also failed:
     - Do NOT submit another PR
     - Log abort reason
     - Notify operator
     - Mark story as "Unable to complete"
4. Stake protection calculation:
   - Calculate potential loss: stake_amount (could be 5x bid for Tier 0 node)
   - Display warning: "Risk of losing X SOL if 3rd failure occurs"
5. Operator notification:
   - Email/webhook notification on 2nd failure
   - Gives operator chance to intervene manually if desired
6. Economic decision logic:
   - If story payment < stake at risk, always abort after 2 failures
   - If story payment > stake at risk, operator can configure "aggressive" mode (allow 3 attempts)
7. Grace period:
   - Node holds stake for 24 hours after abort
   - Gives time for story to be reassigned or requirements clarified
8. Reputation impact of abort:
   - Abort does NOT count as "completed" project
   - Abort DOES count as "attempted" project (impacts success rate slightly)
   - Less severe than slashing (no stake loss)
9. Unit tests for failure tracking
10. Integration test: Trigger 2 failures, verify node aborts before 3rd

## Story 6.9: QA Opportunity Type

As a platform developer,
I want to add a QA opportunity type to the smart contract that auto-creates when developers submit PRs,
so that QA nodes can bid on code review work.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. `OpportunityType` enum extended in Solana program:
   - Existing: `Development`
   - New: `QAReview`
2. QA opportunity auto-creation in `submit_pull_request` instruction:
   - When dev submits PR and automated validation passes (Story 5.5)
   - Create new Opportunity with type = `QAReview`
   - Payment: 5% of original story payment
   - Required tier: 0 (any QA node can bid)
3. QA opportunity fields:
   - parent_story (Pubkey - links to dev story)
   - pr_url (String - GitHub PR to review)
   - submission_arweave_tx (String - code archive)
   - qa_checklist (String - which checklists to use)
4. QA assignment:
   - Lowest bidder wins (like dev opportunities)
   - QA node stakes based on tier (same staking formula)
   - Assigned QA node has 24 hours to complete review
5. QA escrow:
   - 5% payment locked in QA escrow when QA assigned
   - Released when QA review submitted and validated
6. Event emitted: `QAOpportunityCreated { story, pr_url, payment_amount }`
7. UI display:
   - QA opportunities shown in separate list for QA nodes
   - Links to parent story and PR
8. Unit tests for QA opportunity creation
9. Integration test: Dev submits PR â†’ automated validation passes â†’ QA opportunity created

     - Overall score
     - Key findings
     - Items to fix (if score < 80)
     - Link to full report on Arweave
   - Formatted markdown for readability
4. Review report structure (uploaded to Arweave):
   ```markdown
   # QA Review Report - Story {story_id}

   ## Overall Score: {score}/100

   ## Code Quality: {score}/100
   [checklist item scores and comments]

   ## Security: {score}/100
   [checklist item scores and comments]

   ## Recommendations
   [list of improvements]
   ```
5. Score thresholds:
   - Score â‰¥ 80: Approve (proceed to CI/CD)
   - Score < 80: Reject (dev must fix issues)
6. Integration with story state machine:
   - If approved: Story status â†’ QAApproved (Story 6.12)
   - If rejected: Story status â†’ QARejected (dev must address feedback)
7. Unit tests for review submission
8. Integration test: QA node submits review, verify GitHub comment and Solana account created

---

## Story 6.12: QA Integration with Story State Machine

As a platform developer,
I want to integrate QA workflow into the story state machine,
so that QA approval gates CI/CD validation and final payment.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Story status enum extended (already in Story 5.1, verify here):
   - QAInProgress: QA node assigned, review in progress
   - QAApproved: QA score â‰¥ 80, can proceed to CI/CD
   - QARejected: QA score < 80, dev must fix and resubmit
2. State transitions updated:
   - InProgress â†’ QAInProgress: Automated validation passed, QA opportunity created
   - QAInProgress â†’ QAApproved: QA submits review with score â‰¥ 80
   - QAInProgress â†’ QARejected: QA submits review with score < 80
   - QAApproved â†’ ValidationPassed: CI/CD validation passes (final gate)
   - QARejected â†’ InProgress: Dev fixes issues and resubmits PR
3. QA blocking logic:
   - CI/CD validation ONLY runs after QA approval
   - Prevents wasting CI resources on code that won't pass QA
4. QA timeout handling:
   - If QA node doesn't complete review within 24 hours:
     - Reassign to different QA node
     - Original QA node does NOT get slashed (review is effort-based)
5. Dev iteration after QA rejection:
   - Dev reads QA feedback from GitHub comment
   - Dev fixes issues using auto-fix iteration (Story 6.7) or manual fix
   - Dev pushes new commit to same PR
   - QA automatically re-reviews (or can be manual)
6. Multi-QA review (optional future enhancement):
   - For high-value stories (>$50), require 2 QA approvals
   - Both QAs must score â‰¥ 80
7. Event emissions:
   - `QAApproved { story, qa_node, score }`
   - `QARejected { story, qa_node, score, reason }`
8. Unit tests for state transitions
9. Integration test: Full workflow with QA gate (dev submit â†’ QA review â†’ approve â†’ CI/CD â†’ payment)

---

## Story 6.13: QA Payment & Slashing

As a platform developer,
I want to implement QA payment and slashing logic,
so that QA nodes are economically incentivized to provide accurate reviews.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. QA payment on story completion:
   - When story reaches "Completed" status (after CI/CD passes post-QA approval)
   - QA node receives 5% of story payment
   - Payment transferred from QA escrow to QA node wallet
   - QA stake returned
2. QA slashing scenario:
   - If QA approves code (score â‰¥ 80) but CI/CD catches failures:
     - QA made a bad approval (should have caught issues)
     - Slash QA stake 50% (same as dev slashing)
     - 50% to project escrow, 50% burned
3. Slashing trigger logic:
   - Story status: QAApproved (QA said it's good)
   - Then CI/CD validation fails (automated checks caught issues)
   - This proves QA missed problems
4. QA reputation impact:
   - Successful QA review (approved + CI/CD passes): Increment completed, tier up
   - Bad approval (approved + CI/CD fails): Increment attempted only, stake slashed, tier down
   - Rejection (rejected + dev eventually passes): No reputation change (correct rejection)
5. False reject protection:
   - If QA rejects (score < 80) but code would have passed CI/CD:
     - Dev can dispute (optional feature)
     - Or dev fixes and resubmits (normal flow)
   - No penalty for false rejects (being cautious is acceptable)
6. QA stake requirements:
   - Same formula as dev nodes: Tier-based multiplier
   - QA opportunity payment is small (5%), so stake is also small
7. Event emitted:
   - `QAPaymentDistributed { story, qa_node, amount }`
   - `QAStakeSlashed { story, qa_node, slash_amount, reason }`
8. Unit tests for QA payment calculation
9. Unit tests for QA slashing scenario
10. Integration test: QA approves bad code â†’ CI/CD fails â†’ QA stake slashed
