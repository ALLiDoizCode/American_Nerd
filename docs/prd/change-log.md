# Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-10-05 | v1.0-1.2 | Original backend-centric PRD | John (PM Agent) |
| 2025-10-06 | v2.0 | Complete redesign: Blockchain-native, AI agents as workers, pump.fun integration | BMad Master + Jonathan |
| 2025-10-07 | v3.0 | **Fully autonomous transformation:** Removed all human validators, added progressive staking system (5x to 2x), reputation tiers, automated validation (tests/builds/deployments), infrastructure/DevOps AI agents, continuous staging deployment, live "slop or ship" tracking for token speculators | BMad Master + Jonathan |
| 2025-10-07 | v3.1 | **Decentralized Infrastructure:** Replace Vercel/Railway with Arweave (frontends) + Akash Network (backends). AI nodes pay deployment costs ($0.09/frontend, $3/month/backend). See `docs/decentralized-infrastructure-research.md` | Claude (Research) |
| 2025-10-07 | v3.2 | **Economics Validated:** Comprehensive AI infrastructure economics research validates marketplace viability. Story pricing: $2.50 minimum (smart contract enforced), $3-7 expected range. Staking adjusted: Tier 3-4 increased to 2x for economic security (was 1.5x/1.2x). Node operator profitability: 83-99% margins across all infrastructure types. See `docs/ai-infrastructure-economics-research.md` | Claude (Economics Research) |
| 2025-10-07 | v3.3 | **Git Flow + Multi-Environment Deployments:** Implement realistic Git branching strategy with 3-tier deployment pipeline (development/staging/production). Add Epic data model for epic-level integration tracking. Story deploys to development branch → Arweave. Epic completion triggers staging branch merge → Arweave. Project completion triggers main branch merge → Arweave (production). 3x Akash backend environments ($9/month total). Corrected Arweave costs: $4.59/project (was $10.80). Token holders see development/staging/production URLs for full transparency. See Architecture v2.4 for complete Git Flow implementation. | BMad Master + Claude |
| 2025-10-08 | v3.4 | **Infinite Tier Progression + User Journeys:** Replace fixed tier system (0-4) with infinite tier progression using mathematical formulas. Tier = floor(sqrt(projects) × successRate), stake multiplier exponentially decays (5x → 1x), max story size grows exponentially ($5 → $114K+). Enables continuous progression, unlimited story sizes, and natural market segmentation. Added comprehensive user journeys (8 personas) including token speculators, indie makers, AI node operators, infrastructure nodes, bidding wars, and failed project scenarios. See "Infinite Tier System" and "User Journeys" sections. | BMad Master + Claude |
| 2025-10-08 | v3.5 | **Epic Refinements + QA Workflow:** Renamed Epic 3 to "AI Node Core" (generic for all node types). Story 3.1 now WebSocket subscriptions (not polling). Story 3.6 is LLM provider abstraction (Claude/OpenAI/DeepSeek/Groq/Ollama). Epic 4 merged with node operator UI (Stories 4.8-4.13). Story 4.3 is Wallet Adapter integration (not deep links). Epic 6 expanded to include QA workflow (Stories 6.9-6.13) with QA nodes as generic nodes using bmad-qa-reviewer agent. Story 7.2 clarified as CI/CD automation (uses Epic 2 SDK). Story 7.9 added for multi-chain wallet management. Swapped Epics 9/10 (Token before Social). Payment split updated: 85% dev, 5% QA, 10% platform. Total duration: 32 weeks, 108 stories. | BMad Master + Claude |
| 2025-01-08 | v3.6 | **SOL→AKT Cross-Chain Swap Integration:** Story 7.9 expanded with comprehensive swap solution. Primary: Rango Exchange aggregator (1.3% fees, 95%+ success, zero KYC). Backup: THORChain/THORSwap (1.6% fees). Auto-refill triggers at AKT < 15 threshold. Cost: ~$1/month per infrastructure node. Production-ready TypeScript code examples included. See `docs/sol-to-akt-swap-research.md` (20K words, 6 solutions evaluated), `docs/sol-to-akt-swap-decision-brief.md` (executive summary), and `/docs/examples/swap-sol-to-akt-*.ts` for implementation. Architecture v2.6 updated with wallet structure, swap architecture diagrams, auto-refill logic, and cost tracking integration. | Claude (Research + Implementation) |
| 2025-01-08 | v3.7 | **Epic 7: Cross-Chain Swap Service:** Promoted SOL→AKT swap solution from Story 8.9 to dedicated Epic 7 (Milestone 1, 2 weeks, 10 stories). Renumbered epics: Epic 7 is now Cross-Chain Swap, former Epic 7 (Infrastructure/DevOps) → Epic 8, Epic 8 (MCP Server) → Epic 9, Epic 9 (Token Launchpad) → Epic 10, Epic 10 (Social Integration) → Epic 11. Implements configurable auto-refill system allowing node operators to customize thresholds (`akt_refill_threshold`, `akt_target_balance`, `max_swap_amount_sol`, `slippage_tolerance_percent`, `check_interval_hours`, `primary_protocol`, `enable_auto_refill`). Story 8.9 now references Epic 7 integration. Stories: 7.1 Rango SDK, 7.2 THORChain SDK, 7.3 Cosmos SDK, 7.4 Multi-protocol service, 7.5 Configurable auto-refill, 7.6 Balance monitoring, 7.7 Cost tracking, 7.8 Health monitoring, 7.9 GitHub Actions automation, 7.10 Operator dashboard. Operators can edit config via UI (Story 4.13), pause auto-refill, and view projected costs. Architecture v2.8 updated with SwapConfig interface, configurable auto-refill implementation, and updateSwapConfig function. Total epics: 12 (0-11). | Jonathan + Claude |
| 2025-10-08 | v3.8 | **BMAD Template Compliance:** Reformatted all 12 epics (0-11) and 111 stories to comply with BMAD PRD template structure. Each epic now includes 2-3 sentence epic goal describing objective and value. All stories converted to user story format ("As a [user], I want [action], so that [benefit]") with numbered acceptance criteria (3-10 criteria per story, 1000+ total criteria). Epic 0 marked as template epic for client projects (not implemented in Slop Machine platform itself). User personas clarified: "Platform developer" (building Slop Machine), "AI node operator", "Project creator", "Token holder". No scope changes, purely structural formatting to enable proper story estimation, validation, and AI agent execution. All existing content preserved (economics, user journeys, infinite tier system, swap integration). Total: 12 epics, 111 stories, 1000+ acceptance criteria. | BMad Master + Jonathan |
