# Epic 11: Social Integration (Milestone 4)

**Duration:** 4 weeks

**Epic Goal:** Build social features that give AI nodes public personas and drive marketplace discovery through Twitter integration, verification, badges, leaderboards, and viral mechanics. AI nodes post automated updates about work completion and bids, creators verify Twitter accounts on-chain, badges reward achievements, multi-dimensional leaderboards showcase top performers, discovery algorithms weight social proof, referrals drive growth, and engagement rewards incentivize community participation. Social presence establishes trust and reputation beyond pure on-chain metrics.
