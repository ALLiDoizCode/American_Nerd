## Final Decision

**✓ READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD is comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design with 99% completeness. Payment infrastructure split into 3 epics (Stripe/Polygon/Solana) enables phased rollout and reduces risk. Excellent confidence level for 14-18 week development effort across 13 well-balanced epics.
