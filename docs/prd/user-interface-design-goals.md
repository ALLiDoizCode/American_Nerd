# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create a professional, trust-focused marketplace experience that balances sophisticated multi-stage workflow complexity with indie maker accessibility. The platform should feel like a "premium freelance marketplace meets AI-assisted project management tool" - emphasizing transparency, progress visibility, and expert credibility at every stage. Users should experience confidence through clear documentation handoffs, real-time escrow status, and multi-dimensional reputation displays. The MCP server integration should feel seamless - users working in Claude Desktop shouldn't feel like they're "missing features" compared to web platform users.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Workflow progression visualization**: Multi-stage pipeline view showing Planning Phase (Analyst → PM → Architect → UX) and Development Phase (Stories → QA) with current stage highlighted
- **Document-centric navigation**: All marketplace stages center around documentation artifacts (Brief, PRD, Architecture, Design, Stories) - users navigate by "what's been created" not abstract concepts
- **Bidding and matching**: Expert marketplace cards with portfolio previews, ratings, and bid amounts - similar to Upwork but with role-specific filtering
- **Escrow transparency**: Real-time payment status widget showing funded amount, currency type (USD/USDC/ETH/SOL), and release conditions
- **Async-first communication**: In-platform messaging minimized - comprehensive docs are the "conversation" between clients and experts
- **Wallet-native crypto**: Metamask/Phantom wallet connection feels native (not "bolted on") with clear network selection and QR codes for mobile
- **GitHub-native delivery**: All work delivered via GitHub commits and Pull Requests - platform displays PR status, not separate upload flows

## Core Screens and Views

**Public/Marketing:**
- Landing page (value proposition, how it works, expert showcase)
- Expert profiles (public portfolio view with multi-role reputation)

**Client Journey:**
- Brief viewing dashboard (view-only, briefs created via MCP analyst agent in Claude Desktop)
- Project dashboard (current stage, next actions, timeline)
- Planning marketplace browser (PM/Architect/UX expert listings with bidding)
- Development marketplace browser (developer story selection and bidding)
- Document repository (view all created docs: Brief, PRD, Architecture, Design via GitHub)
- Payment/escrow management (fund stages, view crypto transactions)
- MCP setup instructions (for first-time users, guides installation of analyst agent)

**Expert Journey:**
- Marketplace opportunity browser (filter by role: PM, Architect, UX, Dev, QA)
- Bid submission interface (proposal + pricing for planning stages or stories)
- Work delivery via GitHub (all deliverables - planning docs and development code - committed to project repository and submitted via Pull Requests)
- Earnings dashboard (completed projects, pending escrow releases, crypto payout history)
- Multi-role profile editor (separate portfolios for PM vs Dev vs QA work)

**QA Reviewer:**
- QA review queue (assigned stories awaiting review)
- QA review interface (side-by-side: requirements docs vs GitHub PR diff vs automated scan results)
- Approve/reject workflow with detailed feedback forms

**Shared/Cross-Role:**
- Notifications center (bids received, payments released, QA decisions, PR submitted)
- Reputation and ratings (give and receive feedback post-project)
- Settings (wallet connection, GitHub OAuth, notification preferences, role availability toggles)

## Accessibility

**WCAG AA** - Platform must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards given global expert network and professional marketplace positioning. Key requirements:
- Keyboard navigation for all workflows
- Screen reader compatibility for document viewing and form submission
- Sufficient color contrast for trust/payment status indicators
- Alt text for expert portfolio images
- Accessible wallet connection flows (not relying solely on visual QR codes)

## Branding

**Professional indie maker aesthetic** - Clean, modern, technical without being sterile. Visual language should communicate:
- **Trust and transparency**: Escrow visualizations, blockchain transaction links, QA validation badges, GitHub commit history visibility
- **Expert credibility**: Prominent display of portfolios, ratings, multi-role achievements
- **Global accessibility**: Multi-currency support visible, crypto wallet branding (Metamask/Phantom logos)
- **AI-assisted but human-validated**: Subtle AI iconography during brief creation, but expert faces/names front-and-center in marketplaces

Color palette considerations:
- Primary: Professional blue or teal (trust, tech, global)
- Accent: Success green for payments released, QA approved, PRs merged
- Warning: Amber for pending QA review, escrow funding required
- Neutral: Grays for documentation views, expert cards

Typography: Modern sans-serif (Inter, Geist, or similar) emphasizing readability for long-form documentation.

## Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive** - Desktop-first with mobile-responsive design:
- **Desktop primary** (1440px+): Optimal experience for expert work (reviewing docs, coding, QA review) and client brief creation
- **Tablet** (768px-1439px): Full feature parity with adapted layouts for marketplace browsing and document viewing
- **Mobile** (320px-767px): Core workflows supported (browse opportunities, check payment status, notifications) but complex tasks (brief creation, QA review) encourage desktop usage with gentle prompts

**MCP Server via Claude Desktop**: Text-based interface optimization - responses should include markdown formatting, clickable GitHub PR links for web handoffs, and inline data tables for marketplace listings.
