# Epic 10: Token Launchpad (Milestone 3)

**Duration:** 4 weeks

**Epic Goal:** Integrate pump.fun token launches via PumpPortal API, enabling project creators to community-fund projects through token sales. This epic implements token creation in MCP, automatic dev fund selling (20% of supply â†’ project escrow), on-chain token escrow accounts, opportunity funding from token proceeds, milestone tracking for token holder updates, and creator fee claiming. Projects transition from self-funded (creator pays SOL) to community-funded (token holders speculate on success), with creators earning 1% trading fees on pump.fun bonding curve.

## Story 10.3: Token Creation Flow (in MCP)

As a project creator using Claude Desktop,
I want to launch a pump.fun token for my project through MCP tools,
so that I can community-fund my project without leaving Claude.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. `create_token` MCP tool implemented:
   - Parameters: project_id, token_name, token_symbol, description, image_url
   - Validates project exists and creator owns it
   - Calls PumpPortal to create token (Story 10.1)
   - Returns: token mint address, pump.fun URL
2. Token metadata:
   - Name: Project name or custom
   - Symbol: 4-6 characters (e.g., "SLOP", "BUILD")
   - Description: Project elevator pitch
   - Image: Project logo (uploaded to Arweave first)
   - Links: Twitter, Telegram, website (if applicable)
3. Guided workflow in Claude:
   ```
   User: Launch token for my project
   Claude: What should your token be called?
   User: BuildMaster
   Claude: Symbol? (4-6 characters)
   User: BUILD
   Claude: *generates description from PRD*
          *creates token via PumpPortal*
          Token launched! https://pump.fun/token/{mint}
   ```
4. Token creation cost:
   - 0.02 SOL for token creation on pump.fun
   - Deducted from project creator wallet
5. Automatic project update:
   - Links token to project in Solana
   - Updates Project account with `token_mint` field
   - Emits `TokenLaunched` event
6. Initial liquidity (optional):

## Story 10.4: Automatic Dev Fund Sale

As a platform developer,
I want to automatically sell 20% of token supply and deposit proceeds to project escrow,
so that projects are funded from token launches without creator depositing SOL.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Dev fund allocation:
   - When token created, creator receives full supply initially
   - 20% of supply designated as "dev fund"
   - Dev fund held in creator wallet initially
2. `sellDevFund(tokenMint: string, projectId: string)` function:
   - Triggered automatically after token creation
   - Sells 20% of token supply via PumpPortal
   - Uses gradual sell strategy (prevents price crash):
     - Sell in 10 batches of 2% each
     - Wait 1 minute between batches
     - Allows bonding curve to recover
3. Proceeds calculation:
   - Total SOL received from selling 20%
   - Deduct PumpPortal fees (0.5% trading fee)
   - Net proceeds deposited to project escrow
4. Escrow deposit:
   - SOL transferred to project escrow PDA
   - Updates Project account `total_budget` and `remaining_budget`
   - Emits `DevFundSold` event with amount
5. Typical economics (example):
   - Token launches with 1 billion supply
   - Creator sells 200M tokens (20%)
   - Bonding curve pricing: ~0.05 SOL for 200M tokens
   - Net proceeds: ~0.045 SOL to project escrow
   - Enables funding first ~18 stories @ $2.50 each (at SOL=$100)
6. Price impact mitigation:
   - Gradual selling over 10 minutes
   - Each batch is small (2% of supply)
   - Bonding curve absorbs sells without major dump
7. Creator retention:
   - Creator keeps 80% of token supply
   - Can sell remaining gradually or hold for appreciation
8. Transparency:
   - All dev fund sells logged on-chain
   - Token holders see exact amount sold
9. Unit tests for dev fund selling
10. Integration test: Create token, sell 20% dev fund, verify escrow funded

   - balance (u64 - SOL in escrow from token proceeds)
   - total_deposited (u64 - total SOL ever deposited)
   - total_withdrawn (u64 - total SOL withdrawn for opportunity payments)
   - last_refilled (i64 - timestamp of last deposit)
3. `link_token_to_project` instruction:

## Story 10.6: Fund Opportunities from Token Escrow

As a project creator,
I want to fund story opportunities from token escrow proceeds automatically,
so that community-funded projects continue without requiring my SOL deposits.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Escrow funding logic in `create_story` instruction (Story 5.3):
   - Check if project has linked token (ProjectToken account exists)
   - If yes: Withdraw payment from TokenEscrow instead of project creator wallet

2. `withdraw_from_token_escrow` instruction:
   - Parameters: project_token, amount, opportunity
   - Validates sufficient escrow balance
   - Transfers SOL from TokenEscrow to opportunity escrow
   - Updates TokenEscrow balance and total_withdrawn

4. Hybrid funding model:
   - Early stories: Funded from token escrow (if available)
   - Later stories: Creator can top up escrow by selling more tokens
   - Fallback: Creator deposits SOL directly if token liquidity low
5. Budget management:
   - TokenEscrow balance shown in project dashboard
   - Projected remaining stories fundable from escrow
   - Alert when escrow running low
6. Transparency for token holders:
   - Token holders see escrow balance on-chain
   - Can verify their token purchases fund real development
7. Creator fee refill:
   - When creator collects 1% trading fees, can deposit to escrow
   - Extends project runway without selling more tokens
8. Unit tests for escrow withdrawal
9. Integration test: Create token-funded opportunity, verify escrow used
