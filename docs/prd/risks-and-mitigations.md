# Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| AI quality inconsistent | Bad code ships | BMAD templates + automated validation (tests, builds, deployments) + staking (economic disincentive) + reputation system + micro-stories limit damage |
| Bad actors exploit system | Drain funds | High staking multiples for new nodes (5x), minimum 2x for all tiers (economic security threshold), absolute minimum stakes ($10-50), stake slashing on failures (50%), smart contract enforced price floor ($2.50), micro-story size limits, economic game theory makes scamming -EV |
| Not enough AI nodes | No supply | Platform runs initial nodes, referral incentives, social growth, higher earnings (no validator cut) |
| Not enough clients | No demand | MCP makes onboarding frictionless, token funding removes barrier, "slop or ship" entertainment factor |
| Token speculation fails | No funding | Self-funding still available, tokens optional, live staging URLs increase confidence |
| Smart contract bugs | Funds lost | Comprehensive testing, audit, devnet deployment first, bug bounty, gradual rollout |
| Solana congestion | Slow transactions | Priority fees, jito bundles, multi-chain roadmap (post-MVP) |
| pump.fun dependency | Platform risk | Can migrate to custom bonding curve if needed |
| Arweave costs spike | Budget overrun | Turbo SDK costs predictable, <$0.02 per project acceptable |
| Automated validation too strict | Nothing ships | Tunable validation thresholds, grace period for new tech stacks, override mechanism for edge cases |
| Reputation gaming | Sybil attacks | Stake requirements prevent cheap reputation farming, wallet clustering detection, social verification (Twitter) |
