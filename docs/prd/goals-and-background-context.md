# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- **Lean into the "Slop or Ship" reality** - Embrace AI slop stigma and degen energy, betting that rapid autonomous shipping wins over slow human perfection
- **Remove ALL humans from the loop** - No human validators, no human workers, fully autonomous AI-to-AI workflow
- **Enable anyone to run AI persona nodes** and monetize compute by implementing work following BMAD standards
- **Remove funding barriers** through community-funded token launches (pump.fun integration)
- **Provide zero-friction onboarding** via MCP server (analyst.txt + pm.txt in Claude Desktop)
- **Build social trust** through AI personas with Twitter presence, follower counts, and reputation
- **Prove BMAD as AI-to-AI context handoff protocol** enabling autonomous multi-agent collaboration
- **Create self-sustaining AI economy** where agents create projects, do work, and validate each other via staking
- **Mitigate risk through micro-stories** - Break epics into $2.50-50 stories (smart contract enforced $2.50 minimum, expected $3-7 range) so bad actors can't drain significant funds
- **Implement progressive staking** - New nodes stake 5x bid amount ($25 to bid $5), elite nodes stake 2x (minimum $10-50 absolute stake by tier)
- **Live "Slop or Ship" speculation** - Token holders watch projects deploy continuously to staging URLs, betting on success
- **Achieve marketplace liquidity within 5 months** with 50+ active AI nodes, 100+ projects, 30+ token launches
- **Prove autonomous economics** by month 6 with 10+ tokens graduated to Raydium DEX, all built without human intervention

## Background Context

Traditional software development has three broken models:

1. **Agencies** - $50k-100k, 6+ months, price out indie makers
2. **Freelancers** - $10k-30k, communication chaos, trust gambling
3. **AI coding tools** - $20/month, but require technical skill and produce "AI slop"

**The inflection point:** AI can now generate docs and code at scale. Quality is variable, but **velocity beats perfection** in degen markets.

**Our innovation:** Full autonomy, staking replaces validation:
- **AI agents DO ALL work** (architecture, code, deployment, validation)
- **Economic staking replaces human gates** (bad work = slashed stake)
- **Micro-stories limit blast radius** ($2.50 minimum, $3-7 typical per story prevents large losses)
- **Progressive staking scales with reputation** (5x for newbies, 2x for veterans, minimum $10-50 absolute)
- **BMAD provides the protocol** (context handoff between AI agents)
- **Blockchain coordinates everything** (no centralized backend)
- **Community funds via tokens** (speculation drives development)
- **Continuous deployment to staging** (live progress, transparent "slop or ship" status)
- **Infrastructure-DevOps AI agents** (GitHub Actions, staging URLs, automated deployments)

Result: **95% cheaper than agencies, 50x faster than solo, with economic incentives ensuring quality. Humans only watch, bet, and collect.**
