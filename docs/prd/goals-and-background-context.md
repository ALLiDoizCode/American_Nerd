# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Transform software product ideas into reality through a complete expert-validated workflow from brainstorming to deployment
- Provide zero-friction project creation through MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration, enabling users to create briefs and manage projects directly within Claude Desktop or ChatGPT
- Provide affordable access to expert practitioners (PMs, Architects, UX designers, Developers, QA reviewers) at indie-maker friendly pricing
- Eliminate communication chaos and scope creep through comprehensive AI-assisted documentation serving as the "mother ship" for all project context
- Establish quality certification layer combining AI assistance with human expert validation to combat "AI slop" stigma
- Enable global expert network monetization across multiple BMAD workflow roles with escrow-protected payments and cryptocurrency support
- Achieve marketplace liquidity within 6 months with 20+ active experts, 10+ projects posted, and 5+ completed projects
- Prove unit economics by month 9 with 30%+ contribution margin from multi-stage marketplace fee structure ($100 + 5% per stage)
- Create role fluidity ecosystem where indie makers can earn across multiple expertise areas (PM, architect, UX, dev, QA)

## Background Context

The indie maker and non-technical entrepreneur community faces a critical bottleneck bringing software ideas to life. Traditional freelancing creates communication chaos with vague requirements and trust gambling. Fully autonomous AI coding tools promise speed but deliver "AI slop" lacking human judgment and craftsmanship. Development agencies solve quality problems but price out indie makers at $50k+ per project. Most viable software ideas never ship because there's no affordable, reliable path from concept to quality code built by real experts.

We're at a cultural inflection point where AI-generated work has created demand for human expertise, craftsmanship, and accountability. Our platform monetizes the complete BMAD workflow as a multi-stage expert marketplace. Each BMAD agent role (Analyst, PM, Architect, UX Expert, Developer, QA Reviewer) becomes an earning opportunity for human practitioners who validate and improve AI-assisted work. The platform orchestrates six specialized marketplaces with escrow protection, delivering complete project documentation and production-ready software at 40-60% of agency costs while ensuring experts earn fair compensation globally.
