- **Cost:** $500 - $2,000
- **Timeline:** 3-5 days

### Phase 3: Gradual Rollout with Escrow Limits
- Deploy to mainnet with max escrow amount ($100)
- Monitor for 2-4 weeks
- Gradually increase limits ($500, $1000, $5000, unlimited)
- **Cost:** Monitoring infrastructure (~$100/month)
- **Timeline:** 2-3 months

### Phase 4: Formal Audit (When TVL Justifies It)
- Once you have $50K+ in monthly escrow volume
- Use OtterSec or Neodyme for formal audit
