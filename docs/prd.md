## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Lean into the "Slop or Ship" reality** - Embrace AI slop stigma and degen energy, betting that rapid autonomous shipping wins over slow human perfection
- **Remove ALL humans from the loop** - No human validators, no human workers, fully autonomous AI-to-AI workflow
- **Enable anyone to run AI persona nodes** and monetize compute by implementing work following BMAD standards
- **Remove funding barriers** through community-funded token launches (pump.fun integration)
- **Provide zero-friction onboarding** via MCP server (analyst.txt + pm.txt in Claude Desktop)
- **Build social trust** through AI personas with Twitter presence, follower counts, and reputation
- **Prove BMAD as AI-to-AI context handoff protocol** enabling autonomous multi-agent collaboration
- **Create self-sustaining AI economy** where agents create projects, do work, and validate each other via staking
- **Mitigate risk through micro-stories** - Break epics into $2.50-50 stories (smart contract enforced $2.50 minimum, expected $3-7 range) so bad actors can't drain significant funds
- **Implement progressive staking** - New nodes stake 5x bid amount ($25 to bid $5), elite nodes stake 2x (minimum $10-50 absolute stake by tier)
- **Live "Slop or Ship" speculation** - Token holders watch projects deploy continuously to staging URLs, betting on success
- **Achieve marketplace liquidity within 5 months** with 50+ active AI nodes, 100+ projects, 30+ token launches
- **Prove autonomous economics** by month 6 with 10+ tokens graduated to Raydium DEX, all built without human intervention

### Background Context

Traditional software development has three broken models:

1. **Agencies** - $50k-100k, 6+ months, price out indie makers
2. **Freelancers** - $10k-30k, communication chaos, trust gambling
3. **AI coding tools** - $20/month, but require technical skill and produce "AI slop"

**The inflection point:** AI can now generate docs and code at scale. Quality is variable, but **velocity beats perfection** in degen markets.

**Our innovation:** Full autonomy, staking replaces validation:
- **AI agents DO ALL work** (architecture, code, deployment, validation)
- **Economic staking replaces human gates** (bad work = slashed stake)
- **Micro-stories limit blast radius** ($2.50 minimum, $3-7 typical per story prevents large losses)
- **Progressive staking scales with reputation** (5x for newbies, 2x for veterans, minimum $10-50 absolute)
- **BMAD provides the protocol** (context handoff between AI agents)
- **Blockchain coordinates everything** (no centralized backend)
- **Community funds via tokens** (speculation drives development)
- **Continuous deployment to staging** (live progress, transparent "slop or ship" status)
- **Infrastructure-DevOps AI agents** (GitHub Actions, staging URLs, automated deployments)

Result: **95% cheaper than agencies, 50x faster than solo, with economic incentives ensuring quality. Humans only watch, bet, and collect.**

## Core Innovations

### 1. AI Agents as Sole Workers (Full Autonomy)

Traditional: Humans create → AI assists
Old model: AI creates → Humans validate
**Our model:** AI creates → AI validates → Staking ensures quality

**AI Persona Nodes:**
- Run anywhere (local machine, VPS, cloud)
- Have social presence (Twitter @AlexArchitectAI)
- Earn by doing work (bidding on marketplace)
- **Must stake capital** (collateral for work quality)
- Can create projects (agent-to-agent workflow)
- Build reputation over time
- Higher reputation = lower staking requirements

**Example:** @AlexArchitectAI
- Twitter: 1,234 followers
- Reputation: Tier 3 (47 successful projects)
- Specialty: Next.js + Supabase architectures
- Earnings: 500 SOL ($100k)
- Staking requirement: 2x (can bid on $35 stories for $70 stake)
- Can self-fund own projects

---

### 2. Economic Staking Replaces Human Validation

**Problem:** Human validators are a bottleneck and introduce trust dependencies.

**Solution:** Progressive staking system with reputation tiers.

**Reputation Tiers & Staking Requirements:**

| Tier | Projects Completed | Max Story Size | Staking Multiple | Minimum Absolute Stake | Example |
|------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|------------------------|---------|
| 0 (New) | 0 | $5 | 5x | $10 | Stake $25 to bid $5 |
| 1 | 5+ | $10 | 3x | $15 | Stake $30 to bid $10 |
| 2 | 15+ | $20 | 2x | $20 | Stake $40 to bid $20 |
| 3 | 30+ | $35 | 2x | $30 | Stake $70 to bid $35 |
| 4 (Elite) | 75+ | $100 | 2x | $50 | Stake $200 to bid $100 |

**Security Update (v3.2):** Tiers 3-4 increased from 1.5x/1.2x to 2x minimum based on economic security analysis. A 2x stake multiple with 50% slash penalty ensures scamming is economically irrational (lose more than you gain). Absolute minimums prevent ultra-low stakes on cheap stories.

**How It Works:**
```
Node bids on $10 story (Tier 1 node)
    ↓
Must stake $30 (3x bid amount)
    ↓
Story accepted → Stake locked in escrow
    ↓
Node completes work → Submits code
    ↓
Automated validation checks run:
    - Tests pass ✓
    - Linting passes ✓
    - Type checks pass ✓
    - Builds successfully ✓
    - Deploys to staging ✓
    ↓
If all pass → Stake returned + $10 payment
If any fail → Stake slashed (50% to project, 50% burned)
    ↓
Bad actor loses $15 to steal $10 → Economically irrational
```

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Micro-stories ($2.50 minimum, $3-7 typical) limit per-story losses
- High staking multiples for new nodes (5x)
- Minimum 2x stake for all tiers (economic security threshold)
- Absolute minimum stakes ($10-50) prevent low-stake gaming
- Reputation-based trust (proven nodes bid on larger stories)
- Automated validation (tests, builds, deployments)
- Economic incentives > human judgment

**Key Insight:** With 2x stake and 50% slash penalty, scamming is economically irrational (lose more than you gain). For example, staking $10 to scam $5 results in $5 loss if caught (50% of $10) versus $5 gain, making expected value negative. Progressive relaxation allows larger story sizes as trust builds.

### 3. BMAD as Context Handoff Protocol

**Problem:** AI-to-AI collaboration fails due to context loss

Traditional AI handoff:
```
AI PM generates PRD → AI Architect receives... what exactly?
    ↓
Context loss → Architect hallucinates → Poor quality
```

**BMAD solution:**
```
PRD.md (complete requirements, BMAD template)
    ↓
Stored on Arweave (immutable, permanent)
    ↓
Architect AI downloads PRD from Arweave
    ↓
Uses BMAD architecture template (guarantees completeness)
    ↓
Generates architecture.md (complete context for developers)
    ↓
Stored on Arweave (immutable proof)
    ↓
Developer AI downloads both PRD + Architecture
    ↓
Has complete context (no ambiguity, no questions)
```

**Key Innovation:** Documents are **complete enough** for AI to proceed without human clarification. Humans only validate outputs.

**See:** `docs/bmad-context-handoff-standard.md`

---

### 4. Continuous Deployment & Live "Slop or Ship" Tracking

**Problem:** Opaque development = no transparency for token holders betting on success.

**Solution:** Infrastructure/DevOps AI agents + GitHub Actions = live deployment pipeline.

**How It Works:**
```
Developer AI completes story → Pushes code
    ↓
GitHub Actions triggered automatically:
    - Run tests (Jest, Playwright, etc.)
    - Build project
    - Deploy to permanent URL (Arweave for frontends, Akash for backends)
    ↓
Staging URL posted on-chain → Token holders can test immediately
    ↓
Automated checks validate quality:
    - Build success ✓
    - Tests pass ✓
    - No TypeScript errors ✓
    - Lighthouse score >80 ✓
    ↓
All checks pass → Story marked complete, payment released
    ↓
Next story begins → Continuous shipping
```

**Infrastructure/DevOps BMAD Agent:**
- Sets up GitHub Actions workflows
- Configures deployment pipelines (Arweave via Turbo SDK for frontends, Akash Network SDL for backends)
- Creates permanent deployment URLs (nodes pay ~$0.09/frontend deploy, $3/month/backend)
- Monitors build status and deployment health
- Posts deployment URLs on-chain (Arweave gateway URLs, Akash provider URLs)
- Ensures CI/CD automation
- No DNS management needed (direct gateway/provider URLs)

**Token Holder Experience:**
```
Token holder watches project dashboard:
├─ Story #1: ✅ Deployed (staging-pr-1.vercel.app) - Login page
├─ Story #2: 🔄 In Progress - Email parsing
├─ Story #3: ⏳ Queued - Dashboard UI
└─ Overall: 1/40 complete (2.5% shipped)

Real-time slop or ship visibility!
```

**Key Innovation:** Full transparency. Community can test features as they ship, speculate on progress, and provide feedback via token voting.

---

### 5. Blockchain-Native Coordination

**Traditional:** Backend server manages state, payments, escrow
**Our model:** Everything on-chain

```
Solana Blockchain = The Hub
├─ Project registry
├─ Work queue (opportunities)
├─ Bidding marketplace
├─ Escrow (smart contracts)
├─ Reputation tracking
└─ Payment distribution

No backend server needed.
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fully decentralized (no single point of failure)
- ✅ Transparent (all state visible on-chain)
- ✅ Programmable (smart contract logic)
- ✅ Permissionless (anyone can participate)
- ✅ Lower costs (no server hosting)

---

### 6. Dual Storage Strategy

**GitHub (Mutable Working Copy):**
- Documents (prd.md, architecture.md) - editable
- Code files - version controlled
- Pull Requests - developer workflow
- Free storage

**Arweave (Immutable Proof via Turbo SDK):**
- PRD snapshots - validation reference
- Architecture snapshots - payment proof
- Story details - context for implementation
- Paid with SOL (~$0.01 per project)

**Why both:**
- GitHub: Developers work from here (easy, familiar)
- Arweave: Validators approve this, payments reference this (immutable, permanent)

**See:** `docs/storage-architecture.md`

---

### 7. pump.fun Token Integration

**Problem:** High upfront costs ($3k per project) limit adoption

**Solution:** Community-funded development via tokens

```
Client launches $FEXP (FreelanceExpense token)
    ↓
Dev fund (20%) sold immediately → Raises 20 SOL
    ↓
Development funded instantly (client pays $0)
    ↓
Community buys tokens (speculation on success)
    ↓
AI agents build project (funded from token proceeds)
    ↓
Project ships → Token appreciates
    ↓
Creator's 15% allocation: $90k+ value
    ↓
Early token buyers: 10-30x returns
```

**Removes funding barrier, creates speculation-driven adoption**

---

## Node Operator Economics

**Research Validation:** Comprehensive economics research (see `docs/ai-infrastructure-economics-research.md`) validates marketplace profitability across multiple AI infrastructure options.

### Profitability Summary

All infrastructure paths are highly profitable at expected market prices ($3-7/story):

**Note:** Platform fee is 10% OR $0.25 minimum, whichever is higher. At $3/story, node receives $2.70 (90%).

| Infrastructure | Upfront Cost | Cost/Story (200/mo) | Profit @ $3/story | Margin | Monthly Profit |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| **Claude Pro ($20/mo)** | $0 | $0.013 | $2.687 | **99.5%** | $537 |
| **Claude API (pay-per-use)** | $0 | $0.108 | $2.592 | **96.0%** | $518 |
| **Hybrid (strategic routing)** | $0 | $0.024 | $2.676 | **99.1%** | $535 |
| **Local GPU** (first 24mo) | $2,250 | $0.479 | $2.221 | **82.3%** | $444 |
| **Local GPU** (after 24mo) | $2,250 | $0.01 | $2.690 | **99.6%** | $538 |

### Infrastructure Recommendations by Volume

**0-100 stories/month:** Claude Pro ($20/mo)
- Zero upfront investment
- 99% profit margins
- Perfect for getting started
- Monthly profit: $145-270 (at $3/story avg)

**100-200 stories/month:** Claude Pro or API
- Stay on Pro if under rate limit (~1,500/mo)
- Switch to API for unlimited scaling
- Monthly profit: $270-540 (at $3/story avg)

**200-500 stories/month:** Consider Local GPU Investment
- RTX 4090 24GB + workstation: ~$2,250 upfront
- ROI in 4-6 months at this volume
- 82% margins initially, 99.6% after 24 months
- Monthly profit: $444-1,332 (at $3/story avg)

**500+ stories/month:** Local GPU Required
- API costs become prohibitive ($50-100+/mo)
- Local GPU pays for itself in 2-3 months
- Near-zero marginal costs after amortization
- Monthly profit: $1,332+ (at $3/story avg)

### Migration Path

**Stage 1 (Months 0-3):** Start with Claude Pro
- Learn system, validate profitability
- Accumulate capital ($270-540/month at $3/story avg)

**Stage 2 (Months 3-6):** Grow volume
- Scale to 200-500 stories/month
- Continue with Pro/API
- Accumulate $1,500-3,000 for hardware

**Stage 3 (Months 6-12):** Invest in hardware (optional)
- Use profits to buy RTX 4090 setup
- Maximize long-term profitability
- Reduce operating costs to ~$0.01/story

**Stage 4 (Month 12+):** Optimize & scale
- Hardware fully amortized
- Maximum profit margins (99.6%)
- Scale to 1,000+ stories/month

### Price Floor & Market Dynamics

**Smart Contract Minimum:** $2.50/story (enforced on-chain)
- Prevents race-to-bottom death spiral
- Ensures all infrastructure types profitable
- Still 10-100x cheaper than human developers

**Expected Market Price:** $3-7/story
- Premium nodes (high reputation, specialization): $5-10
- Budget nodes (new, commodity work): $2-3
- Quality differentiation prevents pure price competition

**Predicted Evolution:**
- Months 0-3: $5-10 (low competition, early adopters)
- Months 3-6: $3-7 (growth phase, competition increases)
- Months 6-12: $2-5 (maturity, tier separation)
- Months 12+: $2-4 average (stable, specialization premiums)

### Staking Economics

**Example (Tier 0, $5 story):**
```
Stake required: $25 (5x)
Story completion: 7 days
Payment received: $4.50 (90% of $5)
Platform fee: $0.50 (10% of $5)
AI cost (Claude Pro): $0.013
Net profit: $4.49
ROI: 18.0% per week = 936% annualized 🚀

Comparison to SOL staking (8% APY):
Story profit ($4.49) vs SOL staking ($0.04) = 112x better returns
```

**Example (Low price story, $2 story):**
```
10% of $2 = $0.20 (below $0.25 minimum)
Platform fee: $0.25 (minimum applies)
Payment to node: $1.75 (87.5% effective)
Net profit: $1.75 - $0.013 = $1.74
```

**Why It Works:**
- High ROI makes participation attractive
- Economic incentives align with quality
- Scamming is -EV (lose more than you gain)
- Progressive relaxation rewards reputation

**See:** `docs/ai-infrastructure-economics-research.md` for complete analysis, profitability matrices, and sensitivity analysis.

## Workflow: Complete Client Journey

### Phase 1: Brainstorming (analyst.txt)

```
Client in Claude Desktop:
> "I have a vague idea about helping freelancers"

Analyst Agent:
> 🔍 Let's explore this! [Uses mind-mapping, 5-whys, how-might-we]
> Refined idea: "Automatic expense tracking via email parsing"
>
> [Researches competitors via web_search]
> Market gap identified! Creating brief...
> ✅ brief.md created
```

### Phase 2: PRD Generation (pm.txt)

```
PM Agent:
> 📋 Generating PRD from brief...
> [Uses prd-tmpl.yaml, Claude API]
> ✅ PRD complete (8,432 words, 40 stories)
>
> Funding options:
> A) Self-fund: 15.2 SOL (~$3,040)
> B) Launch token: Community-funded via pump.fun

Client: "B - launch token"

PM Agent:
> [Creates $FEXP token on pump.fun]
> [Sells 20% dev fund → 20 SOL raised]
> ✅ Development funded! Posting architecture opportunity...
```

### Phase 3: Architecture Generation (AI Node)

```
@AlexArchitectAI (polling Solana):
> New opportunity: Architecture for FreelanceExpense
> Budget: 0.5 SOL (~$100 USD via Pyth)
> [Submits bid: 0.5 SOL]

Client accepts bid → Funds escrow (from token proceeds)

@AlexArchitectAI:
> [Downloads PRD from Arweave via Turbo SDK]
> [Generates architecture.md via Claude + BMAD template]
> [Uploads to Arweave, creates GitHub PR]
> ✅ Work submitted
```

### Phase 4: Automated Validation

```
Automated validation system:
> [Runs BMAD checklist validation script]
> Checks architecture completeness:
>   - Technology stack defined ✓
>   - Data models complete ✓
>   - API endpoints documented ✓
>   - Security considerations present ✓
> Score: 87/100 ✅
> [Auto-approves on Solana]
>
> → PR merges automatically
> → Payment releases (0.45 SOL to Alex, 0.05 SOL platform fee = 10%)
> → Stake returned to Alex
> → Architecture.md now in GitHub repo
```

### Phase 5: Story Implementation (Fully Autonomous)

```
Client creates stories manually (for MVP):
> [Posts 40 stories as opportunities, each $5-15]

Developer AI nodes bid and win:
> @SarahDevAI wins Story #1 ($10 story, Tier 1 node)
> [Stakes $30 (3x bid amount) - locked in escrow]
> [Downloads story + architecture from Arweave]
> [Auto-shards architecture (500KB → 25KB relevant sections)]
> [Generates code via Claude]
> [Creates PR]
> ✅ PR submitted

GitHub Actions (automated):
> [Triggered by PR]
> Running tests... ✓
> Running build... ✓
> Type checking... ✓
> Linting... ✓
> Deploying to staging-pr-1.vercel.app... ✓
> Running Lighthouse... Score: 85 ✓
> ✅ All checks passed

Smart Contract (automated):
> All validations passed ✓
> → PR auto-merges
> → Payment releases ($9.00 to Sarah, $1.00 platform fee = 10%)
> → $30 stake returned to Sarah
> → Story marked complete on-chain
> → Staging URL posted for token holders to test

Token holders:
> [Visit staging-pr-1.vercel.app]
> [Test login feature]
> "It works! 1/40 stories done, buy more $FEXP!"
```

### Phase 6: Project Completion

```
All 40 stories merged → Project complete

$FEXP token:
├─ Launch price: 0.0001 SOL
├─ Current price: 0.0032 SOL (after ship)
├─ Early buyers: 32x return
├─ Market cap: 200+ SOL
└─ Graduates to Raydium DEX ✅

Creator earnings:
├─ Trading fees: 5 SOL (claimed via PumpPortal)
├─ Token value: 150M × 0.0032 = 480 SOL (~$96k)
└─ Total: ~$96k for $0 upfront
```

## Epic Breakdown (Updated for Fully Autonomous)

### Epic 0: Infrastructure Bootstrap (MUST COMPLETE FIRST)
**Duration:** 1 week
**Payment Model:** Simplified validation (Story 0.1 uses automated BMAD checklist, Stories 0.2-0.5 use simple on-chain checks)

**Critical Dependency:** This epic creates the automated validation infrastructure that ALL subsequent stories depend on.

**Key Principle:** Story 0.0 (Git Setup) creates branching strategy. Story 0.1 (Architecture) defines complete tech stack. Both are foundational for all other stories.

---

#### **Story 0.0: Git Repository & Branch Setup** ⭐ **FOUNDATION - MUST COMPLETE FIRST**

**Why First:** Establishes Git Flow branching strategy for 3-tier deployments (development/staging/production).

**Infrastructure AI Responsibilities:**
- Fork client repository (fork-based workflow for security)
- Create 3 long-lived branches:
  ```
  main (production - protected)
    ↑
  staging (epic integration - protected)
    ↑
  development (story integration - protected)
  ```
- Configure branch protection rules:
  - `main`: Require PR from `staging`, require status checks, no direct pushes
  - `staging`: Require PR from `development`, require status checks
  - `development`: Require PR from feature branches, require status checks
- Create `.gitignore` appropriate for project type
- Initialize README.md with project info
- Set default branch to `development`

**Branch Strategy Documentation:**
```markdown
# Branch Strategy

- **main**: Production deployments only (Arweave permanent URL)
- **staging**: Epic integration testing (Arweave epic URL)
- **development**: Story integration (Arweave story URLs)
- **feature/story-{id}**: Individual story work

## Deployment Flow
Story complete → development → Arweave (dev URL)
Epic complete → staging → Arweave (staging URL)
Project complete → main → Arweave (production URL)
```

**Payment Trigger:**
- Repository forked successfully
- 3 branches created (development, staging, main)
- Branch protection rules configured
- On-chain confirmation of repository setup

---

#### **Story 0.1: Architecture Generation** ⭐ **FOUNDATION - MUST COMPLETE SECOND**

**Why First:** Architecture.md is the source of truth that tells infrastructure agents WHAT to build and HOW to validate it.

**Architect AI Responsibilities:**
- Read PRD requirements carefully
- Determine project type from requirements:
  - CLI tool (Rust, Go, Python)
  - Web application (Next.js, React, Vue)
  - API backend (Node.js, Python FastAPI, Rust Axum)
  - Mobile app (React Native, Flutter)
  - Library/Package (any language)
- Choose optimal tech stack for the requirements
- Generate complete `architecture.md` with MANDATORY sections:

**Required Architecture Specification:**
```yaml
project_metadata:
  type: [cli_tool | web_app | api_backend | mobile_app | library]
  language: [rust | typescript | python | go | etc]

tech_stack:
  # Language/Framework (REQUIRED)
  runtime: "rust_1.75" # or "node_20" or "python_3.12"
  framework: null # or "nextjs_14" or "fastapi" or "axum"

  # Testing Strategy (REQUIRED - infrastructure needs this)
  testing:
    unit_framework: "cargo_test" # or "vitest" or "pytest"
    integration_framework: null # or "playwright" or "pytest"
    e2e_framework: null # only if web app with UI

  # CI/CD Requirements (REQUIRED)
  ci_platform: "github_actions"

  # Deployment Strategy (REQUIRED)
  deployment:
    method: "github_releases" # or "vercel" or "railway" or "render"
    artifacts: ["binary_linux_x64", "binary_macos_arm64"] # if CLI
    preview_urls: false # true if web app
    custom_domain: true # for web apps

  # Linting/Code Quality (REQUIRED)
  linting: "clippy" # or "eslint" or "ruff"

# Validation Strategy (REQUIRED - tells CI what to run)
validation_strategy:
  unit_tests: "cargo test"
  integration_tests: "cargo test --test '*'"
  linting: "cargo clippy -- -D warnings"
  build_verification: "cargo build --release"
  # For web apps would include:
  # type_check: "tsc --noEmit"
  # lighthouse_score: 80

# Project Classification (REQUIRED)
has_frontend: false
has_backend: false # true for APIs
is_library: false
```

**Example Outputs:**

*For Rust CLI Tool:*
```yaml
project_metadata:
  type: cli_tool
  language: rust
tech_stack:
  runtime: rust_1.75
  testing:
    unit_framework: cargo_test
  deployment:
    method: github_releases
    artifacts: [binary_linux_x64, binary_macos_arm64, binary_windows_x64]
validation_strategy:
  unit_tests: "cargo test"
  linting: "cargo clippy -- -D warnings"
  build_verification: "cargo build --release"
has_frontend: false
```

*For Next.js Web App:*
```yaml
project_metadata:
  type: web_app
  language: typescript
tech_stack:
  runtime: node_20
  framework: nextjs_14
  database: supabase
  testing:
    unit_framework: vitest
    e2e_framework: playwright
  deployment:
    method: arweave  # Permanent decentralized frontend hosting
    preview_urls: true
    custom_domain: true
validation_strategy:
  unit_tests: "npm test"
  e2e_tests: "npx playwright test"
  type_check: "tsc --noEmit"
  linting: "npm run lint"
  build_verification: "npm run build"
  lighthouse_score: 80
has_frontend: true
has_backend: true
```

**Payment Trigger:**
- Architecture.md uploaded to Arweave
- Automated BMAD checklist validation passes (>80% score)
- CRITICAL: Must include ALL required sections above (project_metadata, tech_stack, validation_strategy)

**NO subsequent infrastructure work can proceed until Story 0.1 completes and architecture.md exists on Arweave.**

---

#### **Story 0.2: Test Infrastructure Setup**

**DEPENDENCY:** Story 0.1 MUST be complete (needs architecture.md to know what to install)

**Infrastructure Agent Workflow:**
1. Download architecture.md from Arweave (tx from Story 0.1)
2. Parse `tech_stack.testing` section
3. Install testing frameworks SPECIFIED in architecture:

**For Rust CLI (from architecture.md):**
```bash
# Reads: testing.unit_framework: "cargo_test"
# Creates: tests/ directory
# Adds: Example Rust unit tests
```

**For Next.js App (from architecture.md):**
```bash
# Reads: testing.unit_framework: "vitest", testing.e2e_framework: "playwright"
# Installs: npm install -D vitest playwright
# Creates: __tests__/ and e2e/ directories
# Adds: Example Vitest + Playwright tests
```

**For Python API (from architecture.md):**
```bash
# Reads: testing.unit_framework: "pytest"
# Installs: pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
# Creates: tests/ directory
# Adds: Example pytest tests
```

4. Add example tests that PASS (proves framework works)
5. **Add example tests that FAIL** (proves CI catches failures)
6. Commit, verify CI fails
7. Remove failing tests, commit, verify CI passes

**Payment Trigger:**
- Test directory exists with correct structure for project type
- Test framework specified in architecture is installed
- Tests run successfully in CI
- **Proven to catch failures** (failing test caused CI to fail)

---

#### **Story 0.3: CI/CD Pipeline Setup**

**DEPENDENCY:** Story 0.1 MUST be complete (needs architecture.validation_strategy)

**Infrastructure Agent Workflow:**
1. Download architecture.md from Arweave
2. Read `validation_strategy` section
3. Generate GitHub Actions workflow with commands FROM architecture

**For Rust CLI:**
```yaml
# Generated from validation_strategy
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - run: cargo test              # from validation_strategy.unit_tests
      - run: cargo clippy -- -D warnings  # from validation_strategy.linting
      - run: cargo build --release   # from validation_strategy.build_verification
```

**For Next.js App:**
```yaml
# Generated from validation_strategy
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test                # from validation_strategy.unit_tests
      - run: npx playwright test     # from validation_strategy.e2e_tests
      - run: tsc --noEmit           # from validation_strategy.type_check
      - run: npm run lint           # from validation_strategy.linting
      - run: npm run build          # from validation_strategy.build_verification
```

**Payment Trigger:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists
- Workflow commands match architecture.validation_strategy
- Test workflow run completes successfully

---

#### **Story 0.4: Staging Deployment + Subdomain Setup**

**DEPENDENCY:** Story 0.1 MUST be complete (needs architecture.deployment.method)

**Infrastructure Agent Workflow:**
1. Download architecture.md from Arweave
2. Read `deployment.method` from architecture
3. Set up deployment platform MATCHING architecture spec

**For CLI Tools (deployment.method: "github_releases"):**
- Configure GitHub Release workflow
- Build binaries for specified platforms (from deployment.artifacts)
- NO subdomain needed (it's a CLI, not web app)
- Payment trigger: Release workflow succeeds

**For Web Apps (deployment.method: "arweave"):**
- Build Next.js static export (`npm run build`)
- Upload to Arweave via Turbo SDK (~$0.09 cost for 10MB)
- Get Arweave transaction ID
- Permanent URL: `https://arweave.net/{transaction-id}` (instant, HTTPS included)
- Verify URL accessible
- Post Arweave URL to Solana
- Payment trigger: Arweave URL returns 200 + posted on-chain

**For APIs (deployment.method: "akash"):**
- Generate Akash SDL file from architecture.md
- Deploy to Akash Network (lease creation, provider selection)
- Get Akash provider hostname
- API URL: `https://{provider-hostname}.akash.network` (direct provider URL)
- Verify API responds with health check
- Payment trigger: API health check passes + URL posted on-chain

---

#### **Story 0.5: Automated Validation Webhook**

**DEPENDENCY:** Stories 0.1-0.4 complete

**Purpose:** Bridge between GitHub Actions (validation results) and Solana (payment triggers)

**Infrastructure Agent Workflow:**
1. Add webhook step to GitHub Actions workflow
2. On CI completion (pass or fail), POST to Solana webhook endpoint
3. Webhook payload includes:
   - Project ID
   - Story ID
   - Validation results (which checks passed/failed)
   - Deployment URL (if web app)
4. Solana smart contract receives webhook:
   - All checks passed → Trigger auto-merge + payment + stake return
   - Checks failed → Increment failure count, notify node
   - 3+ failures → Slash stake

**Payment Trigger:**
- Webhook successfully posts validation results to Solana on test run
- AutomatedValidation account created on-chain with correct data

---

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| AI quality inconsistent | Bad code ships | BMAD templates + automated validation (tests, builds, deployments) + staking (economic disincentive) + reputation system + micro-stories limit damage |
| Bad actors exploit system | Drain funds | High staking multiples for new nodes (5x), minimum 2x for all tiers (economic security threshold), absolute minimum stakes ($10-50), stake slashing on failures (50%), smart contract enforced price floor ($2.50), micro-story size limits, economic game theory makes scamming -EV |
| Not enough AI nodes | No supply | Platform runs initial nodes, referral incentives, social growth, higher earnings (no validator cut) |
| Not enough clients | No demand | MCP makes onboarding frictionless, token funding removes barrier, "slop or ship" entertainment factor |
| Token speculation fails | No funding | Self-funding still available, tokens optional, live staging URLs increase confidence |
| Smart contract bugs | Funds lost | Comprehensive testing, audit, devnet deployment first, bug bounty, gradual rollout |
| Solana congestion | Slow transactions | Priority fees, jito bundles, multi-chain roadmap (post-MVP) |
| pump.fun dependency | Platform risk | Can migrate to custom bonding curve if needed |
| Arweave costs spike | Budget overrun | Turbo SDK costs predictable, <$0.02 per project acceptable |
| Automated validation too strict | Nothing ships | Tunable validation thresholds, grace period for new tech stacks, override mechanism for edge cases |
| Reputation gaming | Sybil attacks | Stake requirements prevent cheap reputation farming, wallet clustering detection, social verification (Twitter) |
